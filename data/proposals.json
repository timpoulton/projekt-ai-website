I remember back when I first automated a client's inventory system, they were spending *hours* each week just manually updating spreadsheets. Once we integrated the API, it was like a weight lifted.\n\nFor your project, I'd start by diving into your specific data structures and workflow to design the API endpoints using FastAPI and Pydantic for robust validation. Then, I'd build out the core logic with SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Finally, I'd containerize it all with Docker for easy deployment.\n\nIf you're open to a quick chat about your current manual process and how an API could streamline things, I'm happy to share some initial ideas.",

I helped a small e-commerce site a while back that was doing the same thing to track competitor pricing, and it was a total time sink for them. They were basically glued to their screens.\n\nFor your project, I'd start by nailing down the specific color detection method on that website, making sure it's super accurate. Then, I'd build the Selenium/Python bot to continuously check and flag those changes. Finally, we'd set up a notification system (email, maybe?) so you're alerted immediately.\n\nIf that sounds like a reasonable approach, I'd love to chat more and understand the nuances of the website you're monitoring.
