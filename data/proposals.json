I recently worked with a smaller landscaping firm that struggled to automatically pull invoice data into their CRM, and it created real bottlenecks.\n\nFor your project, I'd start by mapping your current deal flow and client communication process.

I remember working on a similar project a few years back, and honestly, the trickiest part was making sure the license check didn't slow down the theme's performance.\n\nFor your project, I'd probably start by duplicating the theme you provide and setting up a secure API endpoint for license verification. Then, we'd implement the client-side validation to check the key before allowing theme download/import. Finally, we'd rigorously test everything to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\nIf you'd like to chat more about the specifics and how we can avoid those early pitfalls I encountered, feel free to reach out. Always happy to brainstorm.",
