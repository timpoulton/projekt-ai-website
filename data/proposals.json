I recently helped a small startup trying to merge a sophisticated pathfinding AI with a physical drone, and the disconnect between the simulated world and the real one was a massive hurdle. We ended up having to build a custom calibration layer to account for real-world physics.\n\nFor your project, I'd suggest initially focusing on small-scale simulations with the robotics component, mapping out the discrepancies. Then, iteratively refining the AI agent's behavior based on real-world feedback. Finally, we could look at building a dynamic adjustment system to handle unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI'm intrigued by the profit-sharing model, and would genuinely love to chat more about your vision and how my background might align.

I've been seeing the same thing \u2013 clients are slowly starting to ask about \"AI visibility,\" but it's still early days.\n\nA few months back, I had a client in the travel niche who was hyper-focused on ranking for local keywords. We ended up spending *hours* manually optimizing Google Business Profiles. Made me think: wouldn't it be great to automate some of that, to surface key trends more easily?\n\nIf we chat, I'd be curious to share some potential content workflow ideas:\n1.   How to integrate a GEO tool into reporting.\n2.   A brief analysis of a single GEO optimization.\n3.   Then, discuss a list of requirements that this should do in the future.\n\nI'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week!",
