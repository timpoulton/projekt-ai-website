I remember helping a local bakery who had the *most* amazing offers but nobody saw them because of spam filters. It's like shouting into a void.\n\nBased on your need, here's how I'd tackle it: First, I'd audit your GoHighLevel setup to pinpoint any deliverability red flags. Next, we'll dive into your email content itself to see if anything's triggering spam filters. Finally, I'd work on properly authenticating your domain and email setup so emails are coming from a verified source and are trusted.\n\nI'd be happy to jump on a quick call to chat more about your specific situation and how to get those emails landing in inboxes.",
