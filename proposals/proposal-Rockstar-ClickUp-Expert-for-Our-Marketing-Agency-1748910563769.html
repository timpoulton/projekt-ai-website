        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are a marketing agency for home service businesses and we're already using ClickUp daily for client management and task management, but we need to ENHANCE our current setup with visual dashboards and better automation.

We need someone to build on what we have and create these 3 Core Dashboard Types:

1) Internal Meetings Dashboard - Visual goal tracking for team performance and KPIs
2) Client Portal Dashboard - Onboarding videos, inputs needed from them, tracker of client calls   
3) Strateg...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! "Integration challenges and automation needs" jumped out at me. I feel that. I spent a week last year pulling my hair out trying to connect a client's CRM to their ClickUp. Turns out, the API key was subtly different than documented â€“ a real facepalm moment.

For your situation, I'd start by mapping out your current ClickUp setup and identifying the data points you need for those three dashboard types. Then, we could build some mockups of those dashboards so you can get a feel of what they will look like. Finally, we could work on the automation to feed these dashboard metrics in real time.

It sounds like a fun challenge. I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to chat more about your workflow.</div>
