        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I read you're looking for someone to build a custom floorplan module with upgrade toggles, similar to Domaine Homes. I get it; manual uploads and toggles for different options can be a real time sink.

Years ago, I worked on a similar project for a builder who was managing upgrades with spreadsheets. It was a mess! We ended up building a custom post type with ACF fields and some clever JavaScript to handle the toggles. It saved them hours each week.

For your project, I'd suggest first creating a custom WordPress module, then building out the upgrade toggle functionality to display each option, and finally integrate this into your home design templates.

Would love to chat more about how we can make this happen and streamline your process. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
