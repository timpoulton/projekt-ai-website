        <p>I have to review hundreds of contracts

I have developed a prompt that works when I put it straight into Claude.ai and run it over one contract.

Now I need to run it over hundreds of contracts. It reads the contract and outputs the key terms of interest to us into a CSV file. This will then help indicate which documents need detailed review by us and a real lawyer as well as help us make some decisions.

I want to build an n8n automation to run it, as this would be easy to improve/update and ma...</p>

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I hear you loud and clear: "hundreds of contracts" needing review is a massive manual headache. Been there!

I remember helping a small legal firm last year with a similar document overload. They were drowning in NDAs. What really moved the needle for them was building a smart workflow that pre-sorted based on a few initial NLP checks. Saved them *days* of sifting.

For your n8n and LLM setup, I’d suggest starting with: 1) Setting up the n8n flow to batch-process those contracts – efficiently grabbing each one. 2) Integrate your working Claude prompt directly into the workflow. 3) Configure the output to reliably populate that CSV with the key terms.

Sound like a reasonable approach? Happy to chat through the details and see if it aligns with what you envision.</div>
