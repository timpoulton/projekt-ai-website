        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Streamline invoicing, reduce manual entry errors, and enhance overall efficiency"—that really resonates with me. I remember helping a friend who ran a small bakery; she was spending hours each week just chasing invoices, and it was draining her.

For your t-shirt business, I'd first want to get a clear understanding of how your QuickBooks is set up and how you're currently handling order data. Then, we can explore the best way to automatically pull that data and generate those invoices—maybe a custom script or an integration using the QuickBooks API. Finally, we’d test it thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

If you're interested in chatting more about your specific workflow, I'm happy to hop on a quick call.</div>
