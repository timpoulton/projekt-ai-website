        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading your need for Cisco experts in EMEA, particularly focusing on "seamless integration and support," I immediately thought of a project I did last year for a German logistics firm. They were spending way too much time manually configuring network devices. It was a classic example of highly skilled engineers bogged down in repetitive tasks.

For you, I'd suggest starting with a quick assessment of your current integration workflows to pinpoint the biggest time drains. Then, we can create a proof-of-concept automation script for one of those areas and test. After refining it, we'd roll it out in phases, ensuring smooth transitions and minimal disruption.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific challenges and see how my experience might be a good fit. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
