        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Hey there, I noticed you mentioned the need for a fully responsive and *custom* WordPress site. I get that. A lot of cookie-cutter themes end up feeling… well, cookie-cutter.

Funny enough, I recently helped a local artist whose website was nearly invisible on mobile. After some digging, we found a conflicting plugin hogging resources, which completely crippled her mobile SEO.

For your project, I’d suggest starting with a deep dive into your brand identity to ensure the design *really* reflects your business. Then, we can map out the necessary plugin integrations for SEO, security, and backups *before* development even starts, so we're covered. Finally, ensure we're validating the mobile experience constantly during development and testing.

Would be happy to chat about your specific needs and figure out a plan that works for you!"</div>
