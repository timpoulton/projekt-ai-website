        <p>We are looking for a skilled developer to create a questionnaire on our website, that, when completed, will recommend a member of our team to the user.

For example of how this should work, go to https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/?skip_redirect_question=1

This feature should search our team database (Can be hosted on Teams or Google Sheet) to match users with the most suitable team member based on their criteria. Ideal candidates will have experience with user interface design and backend ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to create a questionnaire that matches users with the best team member â€“ "searching your team database" and cutting down on manual processes. I get it.

I actually built a similar system a few years back for a local non-profit that was constantly getting the wrong volunteers assigned to tasks. We used a simple series of questions to filter their skillsets, then automatically notified the relevant team lead. It completely eliminated their scheduling headaches.

For your project, I'd start by outlining the user flow for the questionnaire, then connect that to your existing team database (Teams or Google Sheets, no problem). Finally, we'd implement the recommendation engine on the front end, making it super user-friendly.

Interested in chatting more about the specifics? I'm happy to jump on a quick call to see if I'm the right fit.</div>
