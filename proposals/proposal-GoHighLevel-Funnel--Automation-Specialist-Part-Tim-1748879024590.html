        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I run a startup marketing agency focused on helping Dutch service-based businesses grow through funnels, automation, and ads. We’re looking for a GoHighLevel (GHL) specialist to assist with the technical backend — building funnels, setting up automations, and onboarding clients into GHL.

⚠️ Note: This is a behind-the-scenes role — you won’t have any client communication. You’ll work directly with me, and I’ll handle client contact.

We’re starting at ~5 hours per week, with a strong possibility...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to help with the GHL backend, building funnels and automations for your Dutch clients, especially to get away from manual processes. I get it! I remember helping a local cleaning business completely revamp their lead follow-up in GHL. Before, they were drowning in spreadsheets; now, it's all automated, and they actually have time to focus on cleaning!

For your agency, my approach would be to first deeply understand your specific funnel/automation needs per client. Then, I'd build out those flows within GHL, focusing on clean, scalable architecture. Finally, I'd create documentation and training materials specifically tailored for your team so you can confidently manage things down the line.

I'm definitely interested in chatting more about how I can help. Let me know when you might be free for a quick call.</div>
