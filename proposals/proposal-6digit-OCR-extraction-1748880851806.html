        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Input: A multi-page PDF.

Task:
For each page, extract a 6-digit number from a specific location on the page. The 6 digit number is always in the same location on each page

Use OCR (optical character recognition) to read the number in a CROPPED region.

Output: A .txt file listing all extracted 6-digit numbers, one per line.

Platform: Should run on windows 11 locally as .exe

PDF documents which needs OCR is image-based

Output format after extraction is to a TXT file like below

123456

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I get what you're after – automating that repetitive 6-digit extraction. I read where you mentioned the PDFs are image-based and that you would like a txt output.

I actually helped a small accounts team last year who were manually pulling invoice numbers from scanned documents. The tedium was really getting to them! What I ended up doing for them was a Python script using Tesseract OCR with pre-processing to sharpen the image in the cropped area before extraction.

For you, I'd first test different OCR engines (Tesseract, maybe Google Cloud Vision, if accuracy is crucial) on your PDFs. Then, build a Windows executable that isolates the 6-digit number area, extracts it, and appends it to the output .txt file, page by page. Finally, a little error handling to catch anything that doesn’t look like a 6-digit number.

If this approach sounds good, I'm happy to hop on a quick call to chat more about the specifics of your PDF layout.</div>
