        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Our real estate brokerage receives 400+ leads monthly from Zillow, Realtor.com, and Facebook ads. Currently, 73% of leads go cold because our 12 agents can't call them within the critical 5-minute window. We're losing $180K monthly in potential commissions due to slow follow-up.

The Solution We Need
Build an AI voice agent system that instantly calls new leads, qualifies them using our specific script, and books appointments directly into our agents' calendars.</p>

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Losing $180K monthly...ouch. I read that and instantly thought of a similar situation I encountered helping a small insurance agency. They were drowning in online quote requests. The key wasn't just automation, but making the AI sound genuinely helpful, not robotic.

For your real estate brokerage, I'd first focus on building out that engaging, conversational AI script based on your existing agent's best practices. Next, we'd integrate it tightly with your lead sources and agent calendars. Finally, rigorous testing and tweaking to nail that 5-minute response and conversion rate.

I'm really intrigued by the challenge and think we could make a significant impact. Would you be open to a quick chat about your ideal script flow?"</div>
