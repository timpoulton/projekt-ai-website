        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Overseeing outsourced software development operations" – that's a juggling act I know well! I saw you mentioned "manual processes" and that resonated. Early in my freelance career, I spent *way* too long manually tracking developer hours in spreadsheets. It was a nightmare!

From what you've described, I reckon we could tackle this in a few phases: First, establish a unified ticketing system and workflow so that everyone’s on the same page. Second, automate reporting to get project status updates automatically, reducing your coordination overhead. Finally, look at how we can bake quality checks into the process as early as possible.

I’d be happy to chat more about how those steps could look specifically for your needs. Give me a shout if you’re interested.</div>
