        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" - I hear you loud and clear. I once spent a week manually downloading invoices for a client before realizing their accounting software had a perfectly good API! Lesson learned.

Reading your project description, getting those Dial9 recordings straight into Fireflies AI sounds achievable. My approach would be to first, explore the Dial9 API docs to understand the best way to pull the audio files automatically. Then, I'd build a script to format and send those files to Fireflies. Finally, some thorough testing to make sure the transcriptions are accurate and reliable.

I'm genuinely interested in learning more about the specifics of your Dial9 setup. Maybe we can hop on a quick call to discuss the details?</div>
