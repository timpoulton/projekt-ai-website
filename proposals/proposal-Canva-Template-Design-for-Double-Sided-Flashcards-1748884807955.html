        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're looking for Canva templates for flashcards - double-sided, 10 to a page, and easy to customize. I get it; creating educational materials that are both visually appealing *and* functional is a balancing act.

I actually spent a week last year helping my sister design flashcards for her students. We realized pretty quickly that consistency was key, so we built a basic template and just duplicated it, swapping out the text and images. Made things way smoother!

For your project, I'd start by creating one initial template concept based on your needs, then we'd refine it until you're happy. After that, I'd build out the full set, focusing on the ease of customization.

Happy to chat more about the specifics if you're interested! Let me know.</div>
