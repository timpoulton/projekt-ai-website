        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I'm a product designer who's building an early-stage web app — a supportive tool with AI chat and doc summary capabilities for home buyers. I'm approaching beta readiness, but I know "vibe coding" isn't sustainable for real scale, and I am looking for a technically savvy partner to help make sure everything is solid before inviting more users in.

Tech Stack:
Vercel (with v0 builder)
Supabase (user accounts, data storage)
OpenAI API (chat + assistant logic)
Stripe (one-time payment lifecycle mod...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there!

"Vibe coding isn't sustainable for real scale" – I chuckled when I read that. Been there myself! Early on, I built a whole inventory system for a small business on enthusiasm and duct tape. Worked great... until it didn't. Suddenly, error logs and frustrated users.

For your beta launch, I'd suggest focusing on two things: First, let's solidify your data interactions with Supabase, ensuring smooth and reliable data flow. Second, implementing robust error handling around those OpenAI API calls could save you a ton of headaches down the line. We could also map out those current manual processes and discuss ways to automate them, freeing up your time to focus on design and user feedback.

If you're up for a quick chat to explore how those things might look specifically for your app, I'd be happy to connect.</div>
