        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I just signed up for my Salesforce account and am facing too many technical challenges getting started. It would be better for me to hire an expert to take care of the technical work.

I run a small business. To manage my customers, I wrote a simple CRM in a Google spreadsheet. Currently there are 230 customers (rows). I have decided to convert everything over to Salesforce and operate from there.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Facing too many technical challenges getting started"... I hear you loud and clear! I remember the first time *I* dove into Salesforce years ago, thinking it would be plug-and-play. Turns out, even something seemingly simple like importing a spreadsheet can turn into a real headache.

Given you're moving from a Google Sheet, I'd suggest we start with a screen-sharing session to map out your current columns to Salesforce fields. Then, we can tackle a small test import to ensure everything lands where it should. After that, we can work on any automations you will need so your sales team is off to the races!

If this sounds good, I'm happy to hop on a quick call to understand your specific needs better. Let me know!</div>
