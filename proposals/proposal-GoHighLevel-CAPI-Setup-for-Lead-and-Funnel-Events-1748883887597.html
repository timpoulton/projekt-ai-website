        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to optimize lead tracking and funnel events in GoHighLevel with CAPI – makes total sense. Manual processes can be such a drag, slowing everything down.

I actually spent a good chunk of last week untangling a similar setup for a local marketing agency that was losing leads because of cookie issues. What we ended up doing was first, thoroughly auditing their existing GoHighLevel event triggers and custom fields. Then, we mapped those directly to CAPI events. Finally, we A/B tested different attribution models to find the most accurate one for their specific lead flow.

I'd approach your setup the same way: understand your current configuration, build a solid CAPI event mapping, and refine based on initial data.

If this sounds like a good direction, I’d be happy to chat more about your specific needs. Let me know if you're available for a quick call!</div>
