        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I'm building a purpose-driven platform called the Empowerment Quest, which blends personal growth, community support, and non-monetary exchange into a unique, role-based web app. The system uses a custom framework (TRI: Time, Responsibility, Investment) alongside reflection loops (GROW: Goals, Resistance, Outcomes, Ways), and integrates gamification, AI (eventually), and an internal rewards system called eSynergy.

✅ What I need help building right now (Phase 1 – MVP):

A course-based experience...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Hi there! 'Integration challenges' - that really jumped out at me. I’ve been there. I remember wrestling with a complex CRM system for a non-profit, and it felt like every new integration brought three new problems. It taught me the importance of starting with a rock-solid architecture.

For your Empowerment Quest, tackling those integration hurdles for your course-based experience could look like this: First, a deep dive into the TRI framework and how that needs to translate technically. Then, a phased build, focusing on *one* key integration at a time (gamification might be a great first step). Finally, thorough testing and refinement after each phase.

This looks like a fascinating project. I'd be really interested in chatting more about the specifics of your integrations and how we might best approach them."</div>
