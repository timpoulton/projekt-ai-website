        <p>Job Title: AI Photo Editing Developer for Automotive Dealership (Tchek or Similar Integration)

Job Description:
We are a used car dealership seeking an experienced developer to build and integrate an AI-powered photo editing solution to streamline our vehicle imaging process. Our goal is to automate the removal of visible damage (e.g., scratches, dents) and dashboard warning lights from vehicle photos using a tool like Tchek or a comparable AI platform (e.g., Spyne, UVeye). The solution should ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking to tackle the integration challenges with AI photo editing for your dealership, specifically thinking about Tchek or similar. I get it â€“ getting those systems to play nicely with existing workflows can be a real headache.

I remember working on a similar project for a fleet management company a few years back. We tried automating damage assessment, and the AI kept misinterpreting shadows as dents! Took a lot of tweaking to fine-tune the algorithms.

For your situation, I'd suggest first a deep dive into your current photo workflow to identify bottlenecks. Then, we can explore the best API integration strategy for Tchek (or a comparable platform you prefer). Finally, we'd implement a testing and refinement phase to ensure accurate damage removal and warning light elimination.

Would love to chat more about the specifics and see how my experience can help you achieve a smoother, more efficient process. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
