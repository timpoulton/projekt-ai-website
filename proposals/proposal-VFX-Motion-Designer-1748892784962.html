        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Seeing you need someone to ‚Äúseamlessly integrate pre-made 3D models into real footage‚Äù instantly reminded me of a project I did last year for a small indie film. The director had some gorgeous models, but getting the reflections to look right with the on-location footage was a real puzzle ‚Äì spent almost a week just tweaking those!

For your project, I'd focus on: first, really nailing the lighting and camera matching in the comp; then, carefully building the textures and reflection passes to blend with the live footage; and finally, cleaning it all up with post-production color correction in After Effects to create one beautiful scene. I can also select and cut the sound so everything works together.

If you're interested in chatting more about your workflow, I'd be happy to hop on a quick call and see if my experience aligns with your vision.</div>
