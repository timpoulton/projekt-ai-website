        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for a Flutter app with user authentication and push notifications. It sounds like you want something straightforward, and the need for an API for licensing is interesting.

I recently worked on a project where we initially underestimated the complexity of secure user authentication. We ended up spending extra time refactoring the API calls. So, I'm pretty meticulous about planning that part out upfront.

For your project, I'd start by building a solid auth flow with Flutter's Firebase package, then tackle the notification integration using Flutter Local Notifications to ensure cross-platform consistency. Finally, we'd integrate the licensing API with a focus on efficiency.

Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss the specific requirements and perhaps a few design ideas? No pressure at all, just to see if we're a good match.</div>
