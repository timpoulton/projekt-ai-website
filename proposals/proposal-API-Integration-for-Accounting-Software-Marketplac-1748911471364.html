        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Streamline data exchange and enhance functionality" – I get it. Manual data entry between accounting platforms is a real headache. I remember one client, a small e-commerce business, was spending almost 2 full days a week just copying invoices between their online store and accounting software. It was brutal!

Based on your description, I'd start by first mapping out the specific data points that need to flow between your marketplace and the accounting software. Then, I'd build out the API connections using Python, focusing on error handling and data validation from the get-go. Finally, we'd implement thorough testing and monitoring to make sure everything is running smoothly and accurately long-term.

Would be great to chat for a few minutes about the specific accounting software you're looking to integrate and how that impacts the project. Let me know if you’re available for a quick call.</div>
