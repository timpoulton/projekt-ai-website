        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there, Mindeksa!

I saw you're looking for someone to close deals from pre-booked meetings, focusing on businesses that need AI automation. "Manual processes" jumped out at me—that's often where the biggest wins are.

A few years back, I helped a small marketing agency streamline their client onboarding. They were losing leads because it took days to respond. A simple chatbot handling initial inquiries turned things around in a huge way, freeing up their sales team to actually close deals.

For Mindeksa, I'd suggest first focusing on really understanding each prospect's specific pain points during those meetings. Then, highlighting how your AI solutions directly address those inefficiencies. Finally, showing how your team will implement and support the solution, so it's not just tech, it's a partnership.

I'd love to chat more about your approach and see if my experience could be a good fit. Let me know if you're up for a quick call.</div>
