        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're looking to streamline your YouTube process with AI and short-form video, and the phrase "manual processes" really jumped out at me. I get it!

Years ago, I helped a friend who was burning out spending hours just brainstorming ideas, and once we got some automation in place, he was actually excited about content creation again.

For your project, I envision us first mapping out your ideal video workflow and pinpointing where AI can best assist with script ideas and initial drafts. Then, we can integrate that with CapCut & Premiere Pro for engaging edits. Finally, we’ll optimize the publishing process for consistency.

Would love to chat more about your specific vision and how we can make this a reality. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
