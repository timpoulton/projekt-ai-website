        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges"... that's the part of your description that really jumped out at me. I remember working on a Shopify site a couple of years ago, and we hit a wall trying to get a legacy CRM to play nicely with the platform. We ended up building a small custom API bridge - a bit of a headache, but it worked wonders in the end.

For your project, I'd start by digging deep into the specific integrations you need, then prototyping a few solutions in a dev environment before touching the live site. Finally, we'd stress-test everything to make sure it's rock solid.

If you're open to chatting more about your specific needs, I'd love to hear more details. No pressure at all!</div>
