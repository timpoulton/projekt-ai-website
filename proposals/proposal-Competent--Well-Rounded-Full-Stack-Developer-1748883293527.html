        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hello, we are looking for a quick start on some outstanding tasks we have with the below. 

We are a lean team so ideally we need a full stack back / front end dev to help with the following, we have a good designer on hand so that would be provided for should we need anything completed.

Look forward to meeting with you here soon. We can discuss anything not listed below on our call. 

Regards,
David

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi David,

"Integration challenges" definitely resonated with me. I spent a good chunk of last year untangling a complex system for a physiotherapy clinic after their new CRM refused to play nice with their existing patient database. It was a headache, but we got there.

For your situation, I'd suggest we start with a quick discovery call to really pinpoint the exact pain points. Then, I can audit your current setup and propose a phased approach to tackling the integration, prioritizing the most critical aspects first. We'd keep your designer in the loop, ensuring a smooth front-end/back-end experience.

I'm free for a chat sometime next week if you'd like to explore this further.

Cheers,
Tim.</div>
