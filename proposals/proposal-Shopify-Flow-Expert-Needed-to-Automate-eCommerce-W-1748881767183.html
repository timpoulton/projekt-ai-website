        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Hey there, I saw you're looking to streamline operations and improve the customer experience using Shopify Flow – those abandoned checkout follow-ups are key!

I remember helping a small shop once that was drowning in manual order tagging. We set up a simple Flow based on product type, and it instantly freed up hours of their week. It’s amazing how much time those little automations can buy back.

For your project, I'd first want to really understand your current workflow bottlenecks, then prioritize the automations that will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Finally, we’d build and thoroughly test each Flow to ensure everything is humming along smoothly.

Would love to chat for 15 minutes and see if I can offer some actionable advice. No pressure at all."</div>
