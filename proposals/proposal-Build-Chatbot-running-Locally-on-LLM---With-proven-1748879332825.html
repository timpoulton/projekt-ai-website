        <p>I'm looking for an experienced chatbot developer to build a custom AI chatbot for hotel customer support, handling pre- and post-booking questions (availability, check-in/out, amenities, etc.). The bot will be based on an existing tool but fully customized and run on a local LLM (not API-based). Only apply if you have proven experience building and deploying chatbots (please share real examples), ideally using tools like LangChain, RAG pipelines, or LocalAI.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking to build a custom chatbot to handle hotel customer support questions locally, which makes total sense considering the amount of time manual processes can soak up.

I remember a project last year where a similar business was drowning in repetitive inquiries; implementing a localized LLM chatbot freed up their staff significantly, allowing them to focus on personalized guest experiences.

For your project, I'd propose starting with a deep dive into your existing customer support data to identify key question patterns. Then, we can leverage that to customize a LangChain-based chatbot using LocalAI, ensuring it accurately handles availability, check-in, and other common queries in multiple languages. Finally, we'll thoroughly test and fine-tune the model.

If you're open to a quick chat about how to approach this, I'd be happy to discuss your requirements in detail.</div>
