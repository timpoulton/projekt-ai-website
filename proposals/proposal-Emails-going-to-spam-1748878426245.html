        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Emails going to spam for no other reason then being associated..." I read that, and it reminded me of a similar situation a colleague had a while back – frustrating, to say the least! Turns out, some shared hosting issues were tanking their domain reputation across the board.

For you, I'd start by digging into your domain's reputation using a few key tools to see what blacklists you might be on. Then, we'd set up and thoroughly check your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records – ensuring they're configured correctly is crucial. Finally, based on what we find, we can implement a warming strategy for your IP if needed and monitor the results closely.

If you're interested, I'm happy to hop on a quick call to discuss your specific setup and see if I can offer some concrete help.</div>
