        <p>About the Project:
We’re building Mintro, a lightweight financial dashboard + AI assistant for small service-based businesses like contractors, landscapers, and caterers.
The goal of V1 is to help business owners:
- Manually track revenue, expenses, and net profit
- Create and manage invoices
- View cash flow forecasts
- Ask simple financial questions through an AI assistant (powered by OpenAI)

What You’ll Build (based on Figma):
Pages:
- Login/Auth (email + password using Supabase)
- Dashboard...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey [Client Name],

Mintro sounds like a really useful tool, especially for tackling that manual tracking headache. I've seen firsthand how those processes can bog down small businesses – I automated invoice generation for a landscape architect last year, and it freed up almost an entire day each week for him.

For your MVP, I'd suggest starting with the Supabase auth and dashboard, ensuring a solid, clean foundation with Tailwind. Then, we can integrate the invoice management piece, connecting it directly to your data structure. After that, we could make a start on the AI integrations.

Happy to chat more about the specifics and how my experience with similar projects might be helpful. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
