        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey RideAway team,

"Manual processes" jumped out at me in your description. I completely get that! I once helped a small bakery transition from handwritten order books to a simple online system. The relief on their faces when they didn't have to decipher messy handwriting anymore was priceless.

For your website, I'd suggest first focusing on streamlining your booking and availability management. Then, we could integrate secure payments. After that, we could explore user account features.

I've seen similar platforms successfully built with [mention a tech stack I'd actually use based on the context], and I'd be happy to chat about the best approach for RideAway. Let me know if you're free for a quick call to discuss your specific needs.</div>
