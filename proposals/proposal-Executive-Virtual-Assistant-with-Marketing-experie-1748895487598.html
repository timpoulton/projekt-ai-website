        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there! "Improving processes and ensuring smooth business operations" definitely caught my eye. I've spent a lot of my career untangling those types of challenges for smaller businesses.

One time, a client was spending hours each week manually posting to multiple social media platforms. It was a huge bottleneck. After digging in, we realized a simple scheduling tool, combined with a system for repurposing existing content, freed up almost a full day a week for her!

For you, I'd start by: 1) auditing your current marketing workflows, 2) identifying the biggest time-sucks in your podcast promotion and social media, and 3) suggesting some automation strategies tailored to your specific platforms and content needs.

If that sounds interesting, I'd love to chat more about your specific goals and see how I can help. No pressure either way!</div>
