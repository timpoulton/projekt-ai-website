        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Stef,

"Manual processes" in a fast-growing business – I get that. Been there! I spent a few years back in 2015 helping a small bakery transition from paper order forms to an automated online system. It wasn't just about the tech; it was about understanding their customer flow.

For your project, I'd initially focus on clarifying your exact goals for the landing page and funnel. Then, I'd jump into design mockups with a focus on the user experience (assuming this will generate leads). And finally, integrating the email automation and tracking to measure what's working.

If you want to chat quickly about your vision for the project and how I can help bring it to life, let me know!</div>
