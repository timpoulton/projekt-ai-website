Hey there,

That integration challenge you mentioned with the cup holder and phone charging is definitely key. I've seen similar projects where the mechanical robustness wasn't considered early enough, leading to frustrating redesigns down the line.

What I'd propose is first, diving deep into the lounge chair specs themselves to ensure seamless compatibility. Then, we can rough out a few initial mechanical designs focusing on durability and ease of use. Finally, iterating based on user feedback -- maybe even a quick 3D print to get a feel for it.

Happy to chat more about your specific needs. Let me know if youâ€™d like to schedule a quick call to discuss.
