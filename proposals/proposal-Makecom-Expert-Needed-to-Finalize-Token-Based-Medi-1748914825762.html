        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We’re building an automation platform for processing multilingual medical files.
The prototype is already live using Make.com, Airtable, GPT-4, and OCR tools.
Now we need a Make.com expert to help us bring it to a production-grade level.

The consultant should be able to:

Improve logic and data structure

Handle multi-file uploads

Implement token-based usage tied to Stripe and Memberstack

Add fallback, error handling, and retry logic

Assist in preparing the system for real user onboarding

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I hear you on the "workflow optimization" challenge with the medical AI platform – believe me, I've been there. I once spent a week untangling a Make.com scenario that was supposed to simplify document processing, only to find a nested loop that would grind to a halt after a handful of files. Turns out, the data structure was the culprit.

For your project, I'd suggest first auditing the current logic flow and Airtable schema. We can then focus on implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms. Finally, we can tie in the Stripe and Memberstack integration with the token system, making sure each stage has redundancy.

I’m free for a quick chat this week if you'd like to dive into the details.</div>
