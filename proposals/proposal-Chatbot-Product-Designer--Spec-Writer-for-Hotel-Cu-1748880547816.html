        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Characterizing a customer service chatbot for hotels" sounds like a fascinating project! I can definitely relate to the need for this. I remember a few years back, helping a small boutique hotel group move from answering endless calls to a simple SMS based flow – the impact on their front desk staff was HUGE.

For your chatbot, I'd envision a phased approach: First, deeply understand the specific customer service scenarios in hotels (check-in, complaints, etc.). Then, map out detailed conversational flows and identify integration points with existing systems (PMS, booking engines). Finally, documenting the required features, language capabilities, and technical requirements.

I'm curious to learn more about the specific nuances of your customer needs. Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss this in more detail?</div>
