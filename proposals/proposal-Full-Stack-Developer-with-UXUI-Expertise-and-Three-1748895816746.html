        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to build an interactive web app with Three.js and a smooth UX/UI. The "dynamic 3D content" part really caught my eye.

Funny story, I spent a week last year wrestling with camera controls in a similar project. Ended up realizing I was overcomplicating the math and a simpler orbit control setup was all I needed! Taught me a valuable lesson about keeping things lean.

For your project, I'd suggest we start with a clear definition of user workflows and interaction points. Then, we can build out the core Three.js visuals iteratively, always prioritizing performance and responsiveness. Finally, integrate the backend piece by piece.

Interested in hopping on a quick call to chat more about the specifics and see if my approach aligns with your vision? Cheers, Tim.</div>
