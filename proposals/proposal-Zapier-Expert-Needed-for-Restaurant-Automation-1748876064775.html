        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"I understand you're doing everything manually and it's taking too much time â€“ I've been there! I once helped a small bakery chain that was drowning in spreadsheets. The owner was ready to throw in the towel, but we automated their ordering and inventory, and he actually got to take a vacation for the first time in years.

For your restaurant, I'd start by mapping out your current POS and inventory workflows to identify the biggest time-sucks. Then, we'd build a Zapier integration to automatically update inventory as orders come in. Finally, we'd set up alerts for low stock items.

Would love to chat more about the specifics of your POS system and see how we can streamline things for you."</div>
