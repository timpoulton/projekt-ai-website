        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Automatically scans newly listed used cars and alerts me when vehicles are significantly undervalued" – I get it. I actually tried doing something similar years ago manually for motorcycles! What a time sink.

From my experience automating tasks like this, scraping Facebook Marketplace reliably needs a careful approach. A 3-step plan that I think would work well is: first, setting up a robust scraper to pull in the data from your regions, being mindful of FB's anti-bot measures. Second, we need to build the filtering logic based on make, model, etc., as you described. Finally, integrating an alert system so you get notified ASAP of those "quick sale" deals.

I'd be happy to chat more about how we can make this a reality for you. Let me know if you're up for a quick call!</div>
