Hey there,

Saw you're looking to build a Samaro.ai clone with similar functionality and AI integration. That last part, the AI piece, can be tricky. I remember working on a project a few years back that used facial recognition. We spent way too long wrestling with the accuracy depending on lighting conditions – little things you don't always anticipate.

For your project, I’d suggest starting with a solid API foundation, then focusing on iterative mobile app development (web first), constantly testing the AI integration as you go. Finally, we can solidify that Super Admin panel.

Would be happy to chat about the best way to approach the project.</div>
