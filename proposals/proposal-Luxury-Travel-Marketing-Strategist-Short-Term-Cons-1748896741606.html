        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey [Client Name, if available],

Reading about your agency focusing on luxury travel to NZ and Australia really resonated – especially the need to attract those honeymooners and milestone travelers. It reminded me of a client I helped streamline their booking process a while back. They were spending *hours* manually emailing confirmations. Small tweak to their CRM, and boom, all automated.

For you, I'd suggest first diving deep into your existing brand and online presence to pinpoint the bottlenecks. Then, based on that, we could brainstorm 2-3 hyper-targeted lead generation strategies specifically for your ideal customer. Finally, let's find automations to eliminate the manual processes.

Sound like a plan? I'd love to chat more about your agency and what you've already tried. Let me know when you're free for a quick call.</div>
