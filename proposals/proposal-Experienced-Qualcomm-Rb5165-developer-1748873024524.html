        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hi there, 

I am COO at a UK based drone company. 

I am looking for an experienced developer for a short term contract to work on drone software architecture on embedded systems. This requires proficiency either C++\Qt and Linux, have a good understanding of Gstreamer and ideally experience with robotics based applications and protocols such as MAVLINK. It will primarily be working on the Qualcomm RB5165 platform and requires previous experience with integration and writing of drivers and other...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Drone software architecture on embedded systems... Qualcomm RB5165" â€“ that sounds like a really interesting challenge. I've spent a good chunk of the last year knee-deep in similar projects. I was helping a client integrate some new camera tech on a custom robotics platform, and debugging the Gstreamer pipeline took longer than everything else *combined*. Learned a lot about optimizing those configurations the hard way!

For your drone project, I'd suggest we first really nail down the system architecture, especially how MAVLINK will integrate with the RB5165. Then, focus on the critical driver integration, prioritizing stability and performance. Finally, we can refine the Gstreamer pipeline for optimal video processing.

If this approach resonates, I'd be happy to hop on a quick call to discuss the project details and explore a plan of attack.</div>
