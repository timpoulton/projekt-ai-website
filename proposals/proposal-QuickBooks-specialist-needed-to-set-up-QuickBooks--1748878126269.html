        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Streamline our financial tracking, inventory management, and reporting" – I totally get that. I remember helping a local bakery owner who was drowning in spreadsheets before she finally switched to QuickBooks. Seeing her reclaim her weekends was pretty rewarding.

For your business, I'd suggest starting with a solid chart of accounts built around your multiple product lines. Then, we could tackle those bank integrations and set up some smart rules to automate as much of the categorization as possible. Finally, we can look at reporting to clearly visualize your profitability.

Would be happy to hop on a quick call to chat about your specific needs and how I can help.</div>
