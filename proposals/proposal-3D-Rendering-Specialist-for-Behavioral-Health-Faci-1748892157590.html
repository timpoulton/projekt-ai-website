        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for some presentation-grade 3D renderings for your behavioral health facility concept. I get it – conveying that vision to stakeholders and agencies is key.

Funny story, I once spent way too long getting the landscaping *just* right on a retirement home proposal; turned out that's what really sold it to the board! It's those little details that bring the whole project to life.

For your project, I'd start by understanding your site plan and the key elements you want to highlight in the renderings. Then, I'd focus on creating 2-3 really impactful visuals that capture the overall feel and purpose of the facility, paying special attention to the integration with the surrounding landscape.

Would be happy to chat more about your vision and how I can help bring it to life.</div>
