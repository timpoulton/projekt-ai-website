        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" always get my attention! I hear you on the need to overhaul that. I remember when I was working with a small marketing team and they were *manually* tracking campaign performance in spreadsheets. It was a nightmare! We built a simple dashboard that pulled everything in automatically, and it was like a weight lifted off their shoulders.

For your AI Girlfriend platform, I think we could tackle this in a couple of stages: First, really dig into DeepSeek V3 through the DeepInfra API, getting the conversational flow natural and engaging based on those chosen traits. Then, build out a memory system specifically designed to personalize interactions over time. Finally we can make sure those manual processes are reduced.

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and how I can help make your AI companions feel even more real. Are you free for a quick call sometime this week?</div>
