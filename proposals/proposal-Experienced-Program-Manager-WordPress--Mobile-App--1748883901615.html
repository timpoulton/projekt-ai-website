        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking to stabilize your WordPress site and then spearhead a mobile app release, all while prioritizing bug fixes. That "critical bug fixes" part especially resonated â€“ I've been there! Once helped a client who thought their shopping cart was broken, turns out a single rogue plugin was causing total checkout chaos. Drove us nuts for a day before we found it.

For your situation, I'd suggest starting with a focused audit of your WordPress setup, identifying those bottlenecks. Then, based on that, we can prioritize and automate the fix implementation. Finally, ensuring there's a smooth transition and test protocol to catch anything before it goes live on the app release.

Anyway, I'd be happy to chat for 15 minutes about how my automation skills could specifically address these points. Let me know if you're available.</div>
