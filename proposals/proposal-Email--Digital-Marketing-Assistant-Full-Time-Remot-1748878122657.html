        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to jump in and help with email & digital marketing – especially with Klaviyo, Google Ads, and Analytics. The "run email campaigns, manage paid ads" part jumped out at me because I've seen how quickly things can get overwhelming in those platforms without a solid automation backbone.

A few years back, I helped a beauty startup that was bleeding ad spend because their audience segments were a mess. We spent a week just mapping user journeys and automating the segmentation within Klaviyo, and it saved them a small fortune.

I'd approach your needs by:
1. Diving into your current Klaviyo and Google Ads setups to identify quick wins.
2. Setting up automated segmentation based on customer behavior, ad engagement, and product interests.
3. Continuously optimizing based on data from Google Analytics to improve email & ad performance

Would love to chat about the specifics and see if I can bring that same level of clarity and efficiency to your team. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week.</div>
