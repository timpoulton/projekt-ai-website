        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Elevating the quality of my thumbnails to boost engagement..." I totally get that! A great thumbnail is half the battle on YouTube. I once spent a week hiking to the perfect viewpoint, only to realize the raw photo was *meh*. Ended up spending hours in post making it pop and it made all the difference.

For your channel, I'd first focus on identifying the 'story' each photo tells. Then, I'd use targeted manipulation – color grading, selective sharpening, maybe some subtle compositing – to emphasize that story and make it visually irresistible. Finally, we'd make sure the thumbnail looks fantastic on both desktop and mobile.

Would love to chat more about your channel's aesthetic and how we can make your thumbnails truly stand out. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
