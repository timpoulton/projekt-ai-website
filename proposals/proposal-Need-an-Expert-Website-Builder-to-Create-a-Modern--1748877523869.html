        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're aiming for a "fully functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly business website" - nailed it, that's crucial. I get it; the online face *is* everything these days.

Funny enough, just last month, I helped a local bakery finally ditch their paper order forms and move everything online. What they thought would take weeks was up and running within days, and the owner was *thrilled* with the new level of efficiency.

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into understanding your brand and target audience, sketching out a sitemap for optimal UX, and then choosing the right no-code or low-code platform that fits your specific needs.

I'd love to hear more about your brand. Maybe we can hop on a quick call sometime next week to chat about your vision?</div>
