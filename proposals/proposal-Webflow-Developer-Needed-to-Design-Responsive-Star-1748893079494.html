        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Simple, lightweight build; ideal for someone who understands startup needs" – that really resonated with me. I remember when I first started freelancing; every project was a learning curve!

For your landing page, I'd suggest we kick things off with a quick chat to nail down your exact user flow and core messaging. Then, I can put together a basic Webflow structure focusing on mobile-first responsiveness. After that, we can refine the design and add those key sections (hero, features, etc.) you mentioned.

I’ve been working with Webflow since it launched and love its simplicity. If you'd like to chat more about the best way to approach this, I'm happy to hop on a call.</div>
