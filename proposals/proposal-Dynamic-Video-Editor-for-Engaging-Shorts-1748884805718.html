        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! "Maximizing viewer retention" â€“ that's the holy grail, isn't it? I totally get it. I remember helping a small YouTube channel a while back; they were struggling with viewer drop-off within the first 15 seconds. Turns out, the intro was just too slow!

For your shorts, I'd focus on: 1) a hook that grabs attention instantly; 2) seamless integration of b-roll (AI enhanced where it fits) and sound effects for impact; and 3) dynamic pacing with captions to keep viewers engaged from start to finish. I'd be able to help with the integration of AI tools.

Would love to chat more about your specific video ideas and how we can keep those eyeballs glued to the screen. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
