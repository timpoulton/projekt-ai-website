        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about your "automation needs" for the CRM-driven digital business card platform resonated with me. I've seen firsthand how manually wrangling leads after a trade show can kill momentum, and I once spent a week untangling a competitor's messy post-event email sequence for a client â€“ a total nightmare.

To tackle this, I'd initially focus on: 1) building a robust NFC-integrated digital card generator linked directly to your CRM. 2) then, implement automated follow-up sequences based on lead categorization from the event. 3) Finally, develop a user-friendly dashboard for managing leads and analyzing campaign performance.

This all seems really exciting, and I'd love to chat more about your vision. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
