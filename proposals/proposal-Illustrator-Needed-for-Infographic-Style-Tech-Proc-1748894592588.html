        <p>We’re looking for an illustrator with a clean, modern design style to bring a complex technology process to life. 

The final output will be an infographic-style illustration that shows how multiple people, brands, and systems interact in a tech workflow (examples attached for reference of scope, the visual style is more aligned to ref 1).


Our team is wireframing the process in FigJam using text, arrows, and placeholder icons. Once finalized, we’ll hand over the file for you to recreate it as ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I read about needing an illustrator to transform your FigJam wireframe into a visually clear tech process diagram - especially since you mentioned "key pain points" with manual processes. I totally get that!

Early in my automation career, I built a workflow for a marketing agency. We had a similar "spaghetti diagram" of interconnected systems. Illustrating it properly allowed us to immediately identify areas for automation they hadn’t seen before. The right visual clarity can be powerful!

I see this as a 2-step process: First, I'd take your FigJam file and work with you to refine the flow, maybe suggesting some stylistic improvements based on the reference files. Then, I'd create the final, polished illustration in Figma for easy edits later on.

Would you be up for a quick chat about the flow itself? No pressure, just to see if my visual style aligns with what you're imagining.</div>
