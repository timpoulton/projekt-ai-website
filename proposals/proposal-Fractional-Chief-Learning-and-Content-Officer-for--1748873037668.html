        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Easy, jargon-free AI training for non-technical workers" – that really resonated with me. I spent a good chunk of last year helping a small manufacturing firm upskill their floor staff on using AI-powered quality control. They were completely intimidated at first, but breaking it down into bite-sized, relatable scenarios made all the difference.

For you guys, I'm thinking we could start by mapping out the core AI skills your platform targets. Then, we could look at optimizing the microlearning content creation process to maximize engagement. Finally, we can look at how automation can help you scale the content creation, distribution, and personalization process.

I’d be happy to chat about how my automation background could help Pedagogue streamline your operations and deliver even more impactful training. Let me know if you're open to a quick call.</div>
