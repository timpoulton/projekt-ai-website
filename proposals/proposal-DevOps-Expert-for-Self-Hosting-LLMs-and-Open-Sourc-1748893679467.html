        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to smooth out the self-hosting process for Ultravox and n8n. That's cool! I remember wrestling with a similar setup for a smaller open-source project last year, spending way too long manually configuring environment variables. It's a real pain, especially when you just want to focus on the tech itself.

Here's how I'd tackle it: First, a solid containerization strategy (Docker or similar) for consistent deployments. Then, automating the initial configuration and setup of both Ultravox and n8n. Finally, implementing basic monitoring to catch any hiccups early on.

I’m genuinely interested in how you're planning to use Ultravox. If you're open to it, let’s jump on a quick call to chat about the specifics? No pressure either way.</div>
