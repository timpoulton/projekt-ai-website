        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to help drive webinar registrations and demo bookings. That whole deliverability piece can be a real headache, I get it. I remember once spending a week troubleshooting a client's campaign only to find out a simple SPF record was missing. Drove me nuts!

For your project, I'd start by auditing your current email setup to identify any immediate deliverability red flags. Then, I'd map out a segmented outbound campaign strategy tailored to the webinar/demo goals. Finally, we’d build the automation workflows within your chosen platform (sounds like you already have one in mind).

I'm free for a quick chat this week if you want to bounce around some ideas. No pressure either way.</div>
