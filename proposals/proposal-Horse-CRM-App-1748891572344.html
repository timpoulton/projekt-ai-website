        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's the proposal:

Hi there,

Your need for software-to-hardware integration in your CRM app really jumped out at me. I've seen firsthand how vital that seamless connection is. Once, I helped a small manufacturing firm struggling with inventory. Integrating their old machinery directly into their new system saved them hours of manual data entry each week.

For your project, I'd suggest we start with a deep dive into your current workflows across all those portals. Then, we can map out the hardware connections and build a phased implementation, prioritizing the in-app payments and expense tracking to get you some quick wins.

I'd be happy to sign an NDA and chat more about the specifics and your overall vision. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
