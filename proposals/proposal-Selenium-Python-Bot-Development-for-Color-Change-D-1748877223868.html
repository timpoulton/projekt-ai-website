        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are looking for a skilled developer to create a bot using Selenium with Python that will monitor a specific website for color changes. The ideal candidate should have a strong understanding of web automation and experience with Python programming. You will be responsible for developing, testing, and deploying the bot to ensure it effectively detects color variations. Please provide examples of previous work with Selenium and Python in your application.</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for someone to handle color change detection and move away from manual monitoring â€“ I get it! I helped a small e-commerce site a while back that was doing the same thing to track competitor pricing, and it was a total time sink for them. They were basically glued to their screens.

For your project, I'd start by nailing down the specific color detection method on that website, making sure it's super accurate. Then, I'd build the Selenium/Python bot to continuously check and flag those changes. Finally, we'd set up a notification system (email, maybe?) so you're alerted immediately.

If that sounds like a reasonable approach, I'd love to chat more and understand the nuances of the website you're monitoring. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
