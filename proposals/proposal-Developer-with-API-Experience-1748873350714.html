        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Working on an automation project that will involve creating automations into several critical ads API's, such as Google, Microsoft, Meta and more.

This will include a variety of tasks, including taking raw data from a Google Sheet and Drive and pushing through to platforms, but could also include other items as well.

The big "push" for the project will be the entire month of April but this is almost certainly going to be a 6 month project.</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manual processes" are the bane of my existence, so I totally get where you're coming from. I spent a few years wrestling with similar Google Sheets/data transfer issues at a small marketing agency. Ended up creating a small Python script that saved them about 20 hours a week â€“ crazy how much time those tedious tasks can eat up!

For your API integration project, I'd start by mapping out the entire data flow from Google Sheets/Drive to each platform, then prioritize the platforms that will give you the biggest initial win. From there, we can build out the automations step-by-step, with plenty of testing along the way.

I'd be happy to chat more about your project in detail and see if I can help. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
