        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I noticed you're struggling with integration challenges in your general business.

Having automated 200+ similar businesses, I can help you save 15+ hours weekly through smart integrations.

I'd love to discuss your specific needs. When would be a good time for a quick call?

Best,
