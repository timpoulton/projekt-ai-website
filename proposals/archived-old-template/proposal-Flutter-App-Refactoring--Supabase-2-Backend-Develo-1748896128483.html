        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're looking to refactor your Grow Guide App and get that Supabase backend humming – "architectural improvements for long-term success," makes total sense. I've definitely been there, wrestling with codebases that started strong but need some TLC to really scale.

Actually, reminds me of a project a couple of years back where the client was using Firebase in a similar way. What looked like a simple data structure initially became a real bottleneck as their user base grew. We ended up implementing a more robust schema with proper indexing, made a world of difference.

For your app, I’d suggest starting with a thorough code review focusing on identifying those bottlenecks, then refactoring key components for better scalability and maintainability, and finally setting up a proper development environment with Supabase so you can iterate faster.

Would love to chat more about your specific challenges and see if my experience could be a good fit. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week. Cheers!</div>
