        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who has made the leap into building with Generative AI. You’ve shipped real products, know how to work across the stack, and now spend your time exploring what’s possible with LLMs, agents, and AI-assisted development.

This isn’t a spec-following role. You’ll be prototyping fast, working directly with the founder, and building real GenAI tools that push boundaries.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

That "prototyping fast, working directly with the founder, and building real GenAI tools" bit really resonated with me. I've been diving deep into LLMs for the last year, and I've found the biggest hurdle isn't the tech itself, but rapidly iterating through ideas to find something truly valuable. I recently spent a week building a chatbot with a team and we got nowhere - then I spent a weekend alone and discovered a better way.

For your project, I'd suggest we start with a quick brainstorming session to map out potential applications, then rapidly prototype the most promising one using a streamlined framework. Finally, we can integrate and deploy the proof of concept.

I'm genuinely excited about what you're building. Would love to chat more about it and see where my experience might be a good fit.</div>
