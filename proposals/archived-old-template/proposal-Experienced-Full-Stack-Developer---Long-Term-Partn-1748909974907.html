        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking for an experienced full-stack developer to take over the final development and ongoing maintenance of a job seeker transparency website. I'm looking for a long-term partner who is willing to work for a minimal amount now who would be open to the possibility of an equity partnership once things take off.

The website is already created (www.xposedinsights.com) and we have 66 active users. I have been negligent in continuing this project but would like to work with someone to continue ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Negligent in continuing this project" – I totally get that. We all have those passion projects that sometimes get sidelined by…life! I once built a killer automated watering system for my garden, only to realize I hadn't accounted for the rainy season. Talk about facepalm!

Seeing you have 66 users already is a great start. To get things back on track, I'd suggest first diving deep into those manual processes you're facing. Then, let's prioritize the most impactful automations for your users. Finally, we can establish a sustainable maintenance plan so it doesn't fall by the wayside again.

I'm definitely interested in discussing the equity partnership possibility too. Happy to chat more about your vision and see if my skills align with your needs.</div>
