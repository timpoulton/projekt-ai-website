        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for someone to help "promote shows, increase rentals, and grow local partnerships" for Upstage Comedy Lounge. I get it; keeping all those plates spinning in a venue can be tough.

I remember automating the booking process for a small theatre a few years back. The owner was spending hours just responding to emails about rentals. We set up a simple system using Calendly and Zapier, and it freed up almost half their time. It wasn't just about automation, but about getting them back to what they loved ‚Äì the performances themselves.

For Upstage, I'd start by digging into those Facebook/Instagram ads, seeing where we can refine targeting and budgeting to get the most bang for your buck. Then, I'd build a streamlined outreach system for local partnerships ‚Äì keeping the communication personable and efficient. Finally, focus on a Rental specific funnel.

Happy to chat more about Upstage's specific needs if you're interested.</div>
