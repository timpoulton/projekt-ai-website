        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are currently using an i Logic programme on Autodesk inventor to model up a Sheetmetal product with a range of 50-200 components. We want to improve on this and create a more robust APi that allows for incremental improvements.
Can you assist with this?</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's the Upwork proposal draft:

Hi there,

"Improve on this and create a more robust API..." I get it. I've seen firsthand how iLogic can become a bit limiting when dealing with more complex or evolving designs. Early in my career, I spent months wrestling with a clunky iLogic setup for staircase configurations - refactoring it into a proper API saved the company a mountain of time.

For your sheet metal product, I'd start by diving deep into your existing iLogic program to understand its current logic. Then, we can identify key areas for API implementation, focusing on flexibility and incremental improvements. Finally, we would work on a phased rollout, ensuring minimal disruption to your current workflow.

Would be happy to chat about the specifics of your product and see how I can help make things smoother. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
