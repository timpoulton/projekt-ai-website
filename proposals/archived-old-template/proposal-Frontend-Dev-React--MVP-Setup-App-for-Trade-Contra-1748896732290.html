        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We're building a platform called StruktureHQ—a setup engine for trade business startups (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, solar, general contractors). We’ve already completed the product structure, design mockups, and business logic. Now we need a frontend developer to bring it to life.

This is not a CRM, project management app, or quoting tool.
It’s a clarity platform that gives contractors a personalized setup roadmap—step-by-step—with tools, vendors, templates, and AI guidance.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"A clarity platform that gives contractors a personalized setup roadmap" – I immediately got what you're building with StruktureHQ. I've seen so many tradies get bogged down in the admin side early on. Years ago, helped a friend who was starting an electrical business. He spent more time buried in paperwork than pulling wires!

For your project, I'd start with:
1. A solid component library based on your mockups to ensure visual consistency.
2. Connecting the front-end to your business logic to start bringing your roadmap to life.
3. Building the AI guidance integration to make it the clarity platform you envision.

If you're curious about how my React experience can translate into a tangible MVP for you, I'm happy to chat. Let me know a time that works!</div>
