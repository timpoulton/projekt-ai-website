        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey CCTV Focus UK,

Saw you're looking to automate that "lead capture → booking → installer assignment" workflow. That's exactly the kind of stuff I get excited about. I remember once spending a whole weekend wrestling with Calendly integrations for a plumbing company – turned out their issue was just a misconfigured time zone! Details matter.

For your setup, I'd initially focus on streamlining lead capture into Zoho CRM and then leverage OpenAI to pre-qualify those leads. Next, we'd build out the automated booking and installer assignment flow, complete with SMS/email notifications using Zapier's powerful multi-step integrations. Finally, thorough documentation and a walkthrough are a must!

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and what's already in place. Let me know if you're open to a quick call.</div>
