        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to optimize network solutions, particularly with Juniper, Cisco, and Fortinet. I get it â€“ manual configuration across those platforms can be a real headache. I recall one project where we were manually configuring firewall rules, and it was taking days. We ended up scripting it all, and suddenly those days were minutes.

For your situation, I'd initially focus on auditing your current setup to identify bottlenecks and manual processes. Then, we can develop tailored automation scripts using Ansible (or similar) to streamline configuration and maintenance. Finally, rigorous testing to ensure stability and scalability across all three platforms.

Would be happy to chat about your specific needs and how automation could make your life a little easier. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
