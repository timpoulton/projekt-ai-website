        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

That STEM education initiative for neurodivergent youth in NYC sounds fantastic! I noticed you're looking for someone who can jump in pretty quickly to manage things.

I actually spent a couple of years volunteering with a similar program back in my hometown. We struggled initially just keeping track of participant progress and grant requirements. We ended up using a simple shared database, but it was clunky.

For your project, I'd suggest first mapping out all the key deliverables and deadlines, then setting up a centralized system (maybe a project management tool or even a well-structured spreadsheet) to track progress and assign responsibilities. Finally, we could identify any repetitive tasks that could be automated to free up your time.

If youâ€™d like to chat more about how I could help, I'm happy to hop on a quick call. No pressure either way.</div>
