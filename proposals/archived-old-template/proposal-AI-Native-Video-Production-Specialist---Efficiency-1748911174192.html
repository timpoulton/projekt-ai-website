        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's a proposal based on the prompt, designed to feel personal and authentic:

"Hey there, I saw you're focusing on "repetitive work and automation needs" in video production, and that really clicked with me. A few months back, I helped a small marketing team streamline their social media video creation â€“ they were spending hours on simple cuts and transitions. We discovered that a custom-built workflow using Descript (with some clever scripting) shaved off about 75% of the time on those repetitive tasks, just by automating the initial rough cut.

For your assessment, I'd focus on a couple of things: 1) identifying the most time-consuming steps in your test project, 2) exploring how AI tools (like RunwayML or similar, depending on the tasks) can be integrated to accelerate those areas, and 3) outlining a potential workflow to drastically reduce manual effort.

This sounds like a really interesting challenge. I'd be happy to chat more about my approach and see if it aligns with your needs. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!"</div>
