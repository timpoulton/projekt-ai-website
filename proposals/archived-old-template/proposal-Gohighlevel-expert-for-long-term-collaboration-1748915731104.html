        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Good day,

I am a small business owner seeking a GoHighLevel (GHL) expert to help set up an online course and launch an automation-based business. Due to a busy schedule, I would like to outsource this task. I’m looking for a reliable assistant who is also willing to transfer knowledge, as we are currently running an online school focused on AI.

Required skills:

    AI voice development using GHL, N8N, or Jotform

    Automation setup using Make or Zapier

    Chatbot development using GHL

Pl...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a GHL expert to help launch an automation-based business and set up an online course. I get the "busy schedule" part – juggling everything is tough!

Funny enough, I recently helped a coach who was *drowning* in student onboarding, using GHL to automate the initial course access and community invites. It freed him up to actually focus on teaching, which was the whole point.

For you, I'd suggest first mapping out the student journey for your AI school, then building out the core AI voice and chatbot integrations in GHL, and finally tackling the Make/Zapier automations for connecting everything. It's a manageable, step-by-step approach.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific needs and see if I'm the right fit. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
