Hi there,

Saw you're looking to streamline COI creation and AMS360 sync - "efficiency" is definitely the name of the game! I get it.

Years ago, I worked with an agency drowning in manual data entry, and the relief on their faces when we automated even just part of the process was incredible. I remember the office manager actually clapping when the first COI auto-populated.

For your situation, I'd start with mapping out the exact email-to-COI workflow you have now, then identify key data points for AMS360. Next, we could explore automation tools to extract that data and populate both the COI and AMS360 fields. Finally, testing, testing, testing to ensure accuracy.

If you'd like to chat about the specifics, I'm happy to jump on a quick call and brainstorm. No pressure either way.</div>
