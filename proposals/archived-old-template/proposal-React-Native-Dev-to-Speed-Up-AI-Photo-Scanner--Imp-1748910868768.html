        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I already have a working app called ****** on the appstore— it scans product photos (food, cosmetics, etc.) and analyzes the image using AI to show ingredient risks. Everything works, but I want to:

✅Speed up the scan time

✅Reduce API costs

✅Make the scanner camera feel more like a real embedded scanner instead of a basic pop-up

 Scope of Work:

✅Add image compression on the frontend before sending to AI

✅ Add lightweight backend image classification (filter out non-product images)

✅ Route...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" - I definitely hear you. I remember wrestling with a similar issue on a React Native project last year; the image upload pipeline felt like wading through molasses. Turns out, a simple image compression step beforehand made a world of difference for both speed and costs.

For your project, I'd suggest tackling the image compression on the front-end first, then implementing that lightweight backend classification filter. Finally, we can smooth out the camera UI. That approach should minimize API costs and improve user experience, and, hopefully, get that delivery bonus!

Would be happy to chat more about this if you think I'd be a good fit. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
