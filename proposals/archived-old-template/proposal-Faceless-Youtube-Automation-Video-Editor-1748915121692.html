        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about your need for an editor to make videos that make viewers say "Wow" and stick around for 20+ minutes – that resonates. I've spent years ensuring automation isn’t just about speed, it's about keeping that human spark. I worked on a similar project last year where the client was concerned about the AI narration sounding robotic; we ended up layering subtle background music and adding short, dynamic visual cues to match the tone, which really made a difference.

For your project, I'd start by carefully curating clips that build anticipation. Then, I’d focus on seamless transitions and adding bespoke AI narration which is tailored and not a voiceover. Finally, I’d use sound design to elevate the most shocking and viral moments.

Would be happy to have a quick chat about the specifics of your channel and discuss different stylistic directions. Cheers!</div>
