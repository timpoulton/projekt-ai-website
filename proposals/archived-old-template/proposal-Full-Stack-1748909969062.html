        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there, I saw you're looking for someone to help shape the future of your platform solutions from the ground up – that's exciting!

Early on in my freelance journey, I jumped into a project where the architecture wasn't clearly defined, and we spent weeks refactoring. Now, before touching code, I always spend time understanding the desired end state.

For your project, I'd suggest first diving deep into the existing systems and your vision for the platform. Then, collaboratively design the architecture, focusing on scalability and maintainability right from the start. Finally, we'd build and iterate with continuous feedback, deploying with Azure best practices in mind.

If you're curious to explore these thoughts further, feel free to schedule a quick call!</div>
