        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are looking for an experienced After Effects expert to create automated MOGRTs (Motion Graphics Templates) for our clients. 

Clients upload logos, fonts, colours, and a short style prompt. Our goal is to turn that data into a fully branded Motion Graphics Template pack that editors can use inside Premiere Pro without touching After Effects. This process should be automated, probably using code.

The project includes designing elements such as lower thirds, transitions, opening screens, closi...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're aiming to create automated MOGRT packs based on client inputs – logos, fonts, style prompts. That's a neat idea.

I remember struggling with a similar project a few years back. The trick wasn't just getting the code right (that's the easy part, honestly), but figuring out how to handle unexpected font formats people upload. It ate up a ton of time until I built in a pre-processing step.

For your project, I’d probably start by sketching out a robust input validation workflow, then tackle the scripting for the MOGRT generation. After that, we could focus on a clean Premiere Pro integration.

Would be happy to chat for 10 minutes sometime this week if you'd like to explore how I might approach this a bit more?</div>
