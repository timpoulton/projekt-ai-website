        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™re building an early-stage MVP for a platform in the career transition space. The foundations of the prototype have been built in Base44 (React/Next.js export) and we have separately developed a custom skill-to-skill matching algorithm hosted on AWS that needs to be integrated into the prototype. 

We're looking for a developer who can move quickly, take over where our no-code MVP left off, and bring everything together into a working, testable product. This is a short-term, high-velocity bui...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" - that definitely caught my eye. I've been there! A few years back, I spent a week wrestling with a legacy API trying to shoehorn it into a shiny new React frontend. Sometimes the simplest solution ends up being the most elegant... and the hardest to find!

For your project, it sounds like the first thing I'd do is dive deep into both the Base44 prototype and the AWS algorithm to understand the data flow. Then, I'd work on building a robust API bridge to connect them. Finally, we'd focus on testing and iterative improvements to get everything working seamlessly.

Would be happy to chat more about your algorithm and the Base44 setup whenever you have a few minutes. No pressure either way.</div>
