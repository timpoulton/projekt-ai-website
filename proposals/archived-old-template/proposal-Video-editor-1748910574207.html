        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're building AI systems and documenting the journey ‚Äì that's seriously cool stuff. Building things always comes with its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to time management.

I noticed you're looking for help because of manual processes. Years ago, I spent an entire week manually renaming and organizing thousands of files after a shoot. After that ordeal, I knew I needed to automate it.

I can easily help with that. How about we tackle the tedious bits first? We could 1) audit your existing video workflow to identify those repetitive tasks, 2) use automation to streamline the video editing process, and 3) explore opportunities for system improvements.

If you‚Äôd like to chat about streamlining your video process and what that might look like, shoot me a message!</div>
