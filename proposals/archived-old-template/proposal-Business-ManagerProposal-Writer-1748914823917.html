        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Writing and submitting compelling proposals" â€“ that definitely resonated with me! After 20 years as a solo automation freelancer, I know how easily that (crucial!) task can get pushed aside when you're juggling everything else.

I remember once spending a week building an amazing system, only to realize I hadn't even *pitched* it properly. Learned my lesson!

To help you turn those proposals into contracts, I'd suggest we start with: 1) defining your ideal client profile, 2) crafting a killer template that can be quickly customized, and 3) setting up a simple tracking system for follow-ups. This allows focus on finding relevant jobs and growing your business.

Would be happy to chat about how those steps could work for your agency.</div>
