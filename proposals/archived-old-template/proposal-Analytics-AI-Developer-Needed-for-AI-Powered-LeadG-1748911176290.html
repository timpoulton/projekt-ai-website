        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to wrangle data from GA4, Meta Ads, Emarsys, and a custom CRM into an AI-powered dashboard. That integration piece can definitely be tricky! I remember once spending a week debugging a similar setup where the GA4 event naming conventions were completely off, throwing everything out of whack.

My approach would be to first map out all the data sources and their fields to create a unified data structure. Then, I'd build the core dashboard logic using a platform like Relevance or Make (good call on those for future customisation!), focusing on the key metrics the CMO needs. Finally, we'd iteratively refine the AI insights based on their feedback.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific data sources and visualisation needs. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
