I'm looking for an experienced n8n developer to help build a powerful conversational AI agent that will streamline our lead handling and appointment booking process.

Project Scope:
1. AI Conversational Agent

Must integrate with ElevenLabs or a similar high-quality voice/conversational AI platform.

The agent should interact naturally with leads, understand qualifying questions, and guide them through the booking process.

2. Lead Qualification & Spam Filtering

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about your integration challenges with the AI agent and ElevenLabs (or similar) definitely struck a chord. I remember a similar project last year where the initial voice platform integration kept throwing errors – turned out the API needed a very specific authentication flow we’d initially overlooked. Burned a good chunk of a weekend figuring that one out!

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into the chosen voice platform's documentation and API requirements. Then, build out the n8n workflow incrementally, focusing first on getting the basic conversation flow working reliably before tackling lead qualification and spam filtering. Finally, rigorous testing with real-world scenarios to iron out any unexpected quirks.

Would be happy to chat more about the specifics and how my experience might be a good fit. Feel free to send over a message.</div>
