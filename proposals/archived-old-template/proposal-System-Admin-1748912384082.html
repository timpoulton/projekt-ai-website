        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a Systems Administrator with a focus on "automation needs" at George Regional Health System. That jumped out at me. I've spent the last 20 years neck-deep in automating systems, and I know hospitals often have unique (and sometimesâ€¦ shall we say, *interesting*) legacy systems to wrangle. One time, I spent a week reverse-engineering a patient database integration that was literally held together with duct tape and prayer!

To address your specific pain points, I'd start by auditing your existing infrastructure to identify the quick wins for automation, then prioritize the areas where efficiency gains would have the biggest impact. Finally, we can strategize how to best implement those automations, keeping the day-to-day workflow of your team in mind.

I'd be happy to chat about your specific challenges at George Regional and share a few more concrete ideas. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
