        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Helping ensure that attribution, tracking, and conversion flows are actually set up to drive measurable business outcomes" – that really resonated with me. I've seen firsthand how much time and money is wasted when those things aren't humming.

A few years back, I inherited a campaign where the client swore leads were crap. Turns out, the CRM wasn't properly linked to the landing pages, so the *real* source was completely off! Lesson learned: sometimes the problem isn't the ads, it's the plumbing.

For your project, I'd suggest first auditing your current tracking setup across all platforms. Then, we can map out a refined attribution model and streamline the conversion process for higher quality lead generation.

If you're up for a quick chat to see if my experience lines up with what you're looking for, I’m happy to jump on a call!</div>
