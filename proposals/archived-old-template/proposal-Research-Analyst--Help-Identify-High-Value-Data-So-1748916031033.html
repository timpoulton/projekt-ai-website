We run a sports/esport analysis newsletter that uncovers betting ‚Äúedges‚Äù through smart, witty, and AI-assisted analysis.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"AI is only as good as the data it's fed" ‚Äì absolutely spot on. I've seen firsthand how crucial solid data is for automation, especially when trying to find that "edge." I once spent a week troubleshooting a fantasy football bot that was getting its projections from a site that updated *after* games started!

For this project, I'd start by identifying a few key sports/esports you're most interested in. Then, I'd dive into my network and research both the obvious (APIs, mainstream stats sites) and the less obvious (niche forums, specialized data providers). Finally, I can compile a detailed report with my findings, categorizing data sources by accuracy, timeliness, and uniqueness, just as you described.

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and see if I can help.</div>
