        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for someone to build an e-commerce site inspired by Elevated Faith, focusing on "Bible Made Easy" through apparel and household items. That resonates with me – I actually helped a local church a few years back revamp their online presence, and the biggest challenge was making the shop as visually engaging as the message.

To get your site off the ground, I'd start by replicating that Elevated Faith feel in Elementor, then integrate WooCommerce so that your products are easy to manage. Finally, we'd focus on making each page truly responsive so that it looks great on any device.

If you're open to a quick chat, I'd love to hear more about your vision and see if my experience aligns well with what you're looking for.</div>
