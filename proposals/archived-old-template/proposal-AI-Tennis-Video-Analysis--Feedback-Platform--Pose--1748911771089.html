        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are building an AI-powered tennis performance feedback platform aimed at amateur players and coaches. The MVP will analyze uploaded tennis stroke videos (serve and forehand) using AI pose estimation to detect body joints and provide automated biomechanical feedback (e.g., knee bend, toss height, racket angle).

What we need:

Build video pose detection pipeline using MediaPipe, OpenPose, or MoveNet

Extract joint positions and calculate key angles for tennis strokes

Create simple rules to ge...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's a proposal crafted as Timothy Poulton, automation specialist:

"Hi there,

I saw you're looking to build a tennis analysis platform using pose estimation to give players feedback, and the biomechanical element really jumped out at me. I recently helped a local physiotherapy clinic automate their patient assessment process using similar pose-tracking tech – the real challenge was translating raw data into actionable insights for the therapists.

For your project, I'd start with a deep dive into MediaPipe or MoveNet to find the best balance of accuracy and processing speed for video analysis. Then, I'd focus on crafting simple, understandable rules to convert joint angles into meaningful feedback on knee bend or racket angle, using the tennis stroke language you're aiming for. Finally, build a simple interface to display results and feedback.

If you'd like to chat about the specific challenges you foresee, I'm happy to hop on a quick call. It sounds like a fun project!
