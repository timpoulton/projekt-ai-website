        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to wrangle AdMob mediation with Unity, AppLovin, and the gang. I get it; juggling multiple networks can be a real headache. I remember one client who had a completely manual waterfall setup - they were practically living in the AdMob dashboard!

For your project, I'd start by auditing your current setup (if you have one) to identify any immediate bottlenecks. Then, I'd focus on building a robust mediation stack with those networks, prioritizing the best eCPM and fill rates. Finally, we'd implement continuous monitoring and optimization, tweaking the waterfall or bidding strategies as needed to squeeze every last drop of revenue.

If you'd like to chat about your specific needs and how I can help streamline things, let me know.</div>
