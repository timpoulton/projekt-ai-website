        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're wrestling with integrating AI into your to-do list app, especially getting all the pieces talking to each other. I totally get it! I remember helping a client build a CRM system once, and the biggest hurdle was getting the payment gateway to smoothly communicate with their inventory management. Felt like herding cats!

For your project, Iâ€™d start by diving deep into your existing FlutterFlow setup and identifying the specific integration points causing friction. Then, I'd focus on building robust connectors between FlutterFlow, Supabase, n8n and your AI features, prioritizing a user-friendly experience. Finally, thorough testing is crucial to iron out any glitches before launch.

Would love to chat more about the specifics of your setup and see how I can help bring your vision to life. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime.</div>
