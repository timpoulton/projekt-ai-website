        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are Telco Management, an Australian telecommunications provider, looking for a capable and transparent developer to build a webhook-based integration between our ticketing platform (HappyFox) and our partner’s broadband diagnostic system (Carbon).

This project replaces a failed engagement — the previous developer did not deliver code or share a development environment. You’ll be starting fresh with a clear scope and structured expectations from day one.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey Telco Management,

Reading about your failed engagement with the previous developer really resonated. I've definitely been there – seen projects stall when collaboration breaks down. Once spent a week reverse-engineering a competitor’s API because the original dev vanished. It's frustrating!

For this HappyFox/Carbon integration, I'd suggest starting with a solid webhook listener that confirms data integrity at the point of trigger. Then, we'd build out the Carbon API interactions in a modular way, making it easier to test and debug. Finally, proper logging from day one is critical so that if something doesn’t work in the future, it is far easier to discover the issue.

It sounds like a well-defined project. Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your specific needs and how my experience might be a fit. Cheers, Timothy.</div>
