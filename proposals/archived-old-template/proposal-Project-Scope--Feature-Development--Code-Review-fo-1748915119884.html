ðŸ§  Context
Mouqa is a mobile dating application developed in React Native (Expo), designed to enable halal relationships within an Islamic framework. The app handles different user roles (man, woman, wali/guardian), includes animated UI, custom theming, OTP login (via Supabase), and a structured profile creation flow.

We are looking for a developer to assist with a targeted feature batch and perform code/database review.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're looking for someone to help with feature development and a code review for Mouqa. That push notification module particularly caught my eye.

Years ago, I worked on a similar React Native dating app that *didn't* have solid notifications from the start. User engagement absolutely tanked. Lesson learned: proper notifications are key!

For Mouqa, I'd suggest first focusing on nailing the notification architecture in Expo. Then, we can integrate it with your Supabase backend, ensuring it respects the different user roles. Finally, I'd meticulously review the existing code to catch any potential bottlenecks or security concerns.

Sounds like an interesting project. I'm happy to chat more about your specific needs and see if my experience fits. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
