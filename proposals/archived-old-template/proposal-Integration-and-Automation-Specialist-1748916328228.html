        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Saw you're looking to reduce manual work across ClickUp, QuickBooks, and Xero – that's music to my ears! Been there, untangled that. I once spent a week helping a landscape architect integrate their drone imagery with their accounting system; turns out, just mapping the right fields saved them *days* each month.

For you, I'd suggest starting with a quick workflow audit to pinpoint the biggest bottlenecks, then designing a phased integration plan focusing on ClickUp and your accounting software. Finally, we’d build and test those automations in stages, ensuring everything plays nicely together.

Would love to chat about your specific workflows and see where we can squeeze out some extra efficiency. Let me know if you're free for a quick call."</div>
