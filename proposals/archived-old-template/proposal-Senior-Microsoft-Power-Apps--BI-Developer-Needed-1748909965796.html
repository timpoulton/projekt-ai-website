        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to "design an innovative app tailored to [your] business needs." That really resonated with me. A few years back, I worked with a small logistics company that was drowning in paperwork, and building a custom Power App to track shipments was a game-changer for them.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your current processes to map out the app's core functionalities. Then, we can brainstorm a first iteration of the app design and get some feedback on it. Finally, we can work on integrating Power BI to give you the insights you need.

If this approach sounds good, Iâ€™d be happy to hop on a quick call to chat about the details. No pressure either way!</div>
