        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's that Upwork proposal:

Hey there,

"Integration challenges" caught my eye in your description. I've definitely been there! I remember one CyberArk implementation where the LDAP integration kept throwing curveballs. Turned out, a seemingly insignificant firewall rule was the culprit, and it took a deep dive into the logs to pinpoint.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a thorough assessment of your current infrastructure and desired state, then focusing on a phased implementation approach, prioritizing the most critical accounts first. Finally, we'd document everything meticulously and build out a knowledge base to empower your team.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific integration hurdles and how I can help you get things running smoothly. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
