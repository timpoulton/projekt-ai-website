        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are seeking an automation expert to build a robust, scheduled integration that connects an Excel file hosted in SharePoint with our Pipedrive CRM, specifically the Quotes module.

The workflow should run on an hourly basis to detect:

*New quote entries
*Changes in quote statuses

Based on this, the workflow should either:

*Create new records in Pipedrive
*Update existing ones

Hi there,

"Automation needs" â€“ I get it. Trying to keep Excel and Pipedrive talking can feel like herding cats, especially when quotes are involved. I wrestled with a similar SharePoint/CRM sync for a manufacturing client last year. They were manually updating lead times and costing themselves hours each week.

For your project, I'd first focus on securely connecting to both SharePoint and Pipedrive using the platform of your choice (I'm comfortable with all of them, but let's discuss what makes most sense for your security requirements). Then, we'd build the hourly trigger to detect those quote changes, followed by setting up the logic to either create new Pipedrive deals or update existing ones based on the detected status.

I'm confident we can streamline this. Fancy hopping on a quick call to discuss the specifics of your Excel structure?

Best,

Tim</div>
