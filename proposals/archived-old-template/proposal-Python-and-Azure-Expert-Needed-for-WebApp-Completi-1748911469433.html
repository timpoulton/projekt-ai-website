        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading about the "integration challenges" with your Azure to Tradelocker API WebApp definitely resonated. I recently helped a client who'd used AI to bootstrap a similar project, and the biggest hurdle was getting the different components to *really* talk to each other efficiently â€“ the devil was in the API details, definitely.

What I'd suggest is first, a deep dive into the existing code to map out the current API flow. Then, we can pinpoint the bottlenecks and use Python to smooth out the data exchange. Finally, some Azure-specific optimization to keep things humming.

If you think that sounds like a reasonable path forward, I'd be happy to hop on a quick call to discuss the specifics further. No pressure either way!</div>
