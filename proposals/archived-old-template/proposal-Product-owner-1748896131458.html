        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Key Pain Points Detected: manual processes" - that jumped out at me. I’ve spent the last 20 years automating workflows and I know how those manual bottlenecks can really choke a project. A few years back, I helped a small marketing team escape from copy/pasting client data by implementing a single integration - the time they saved was insane.

For you, I’m thinking we could start by mapping your current client communication and functional direction touchpoints. From there, identify the easy automation wins (the low-hanging fruit). And then, build out a long-term roadmap for more complex areas.

Would love to chat more about your current set up and see where I might be a good fit.</div>
