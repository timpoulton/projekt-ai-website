        <p>I’m looking for a reliable intermediate developer to work with me 1-on-1 on a long-term basis. My setup is custom-built, so I need someone who can dive deep into the project, understand how everything works, and help maintain and improve it over time.

About the Project:
	•	I run a custom-built eCommerce store, hosted on Shopify.

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manual processes" jumped out at me. I remember one project where generating shipping labels manually was eating up a huge chunk of the client's day. It was a simple enough fix – an automated script tied into their order system – but it was amazing to see the relief when it was done.

For your Shopify/GCP setup, I'd want to first understand the existing PDF generation process in detail. Then, we can look at streamlining that with GCP functions triggered by Shopify events. Finally, we can explore ways to automate PDF delivery and storage, maybe using Cloud Storage buckets.

I'd be happy to hop on a quick call to chat more about the specifics and see if my experience aligns with what you're looking for. No pressure either way.</div>
