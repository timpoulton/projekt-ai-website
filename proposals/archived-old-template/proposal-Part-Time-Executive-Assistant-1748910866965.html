        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Streamlining communications and contributing to overall efficiency" definitely resonates with me. I've seen firsthand how a little focused automation can free up founders to actually, you know, *found*! Years ago, I helped a small agency owner who was drowning in email finally get some breathing room by automating his onboarding sequence. It was simple, but it completely changed his week.

For you, I'd suggest initially focusing on calendar management and filtering/prioritizing your incoming communications. Then, we could look at automating some of the more repetitive tasks within your marketing automation consultancy itself.

Would love to chat briefly about your current setup and explore some quick wins. No pressure either way.</div>
