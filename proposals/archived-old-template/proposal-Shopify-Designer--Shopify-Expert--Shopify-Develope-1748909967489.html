        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Setting up and customizing our online store" â€“ I totally get it. Building a great Shopify store can feel like wrangling a wild beast sometimes! I remember once spending a whole weekend battling a wonky payment gateway integration that turned out to be a single misplaced comma in the code.

To get your store looking fantastic and running smoothly, I'd focus on: First, nailing down your theme customization to really reflect your brand. Then, strategically integrating apps to boost user experience. And finally, ensuring those payment gateways are rock solid.

Would you be open to a quick chat sometime this week? I'd love to hear more about your vision for the store.</div>
