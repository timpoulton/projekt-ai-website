        <p>I will reply to every response, don't worry about your credits.

Looking for a mentor to mentor me on optimising my JIT webinar funnel.

It's all setup, I'm currently AB testing different ad hooks and have some early traction. Just need someone know has done this before and knows what works to really pick apart my funnel, ads and webinar to tell me what is my biggest limiter/bottleneck and perhaps some suggestions on how we could improve it.

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey Owain,

"Biggest limiter/bottleneck" – I get that feeling! I've been there with my own marketing efforts. Remember spending weeks optimizing a lead magnet, only to realize the landing page copy was the real culprit? Sometimes it's the obvious thing staring you right in the face.

Based on your description, I reckon we could start by taking a deep dive into your current conversion rates at each stage (ads, landing page, webinar). Then, I'd want to pick apart the actual webinar content itself – engagement, call to action, etc. Finally, let's brainstorm some rapid-fire, easily testable improvements.

I'm happy to hop on a quick call to chat through your setup in more detail. No pressure either way!</div>
