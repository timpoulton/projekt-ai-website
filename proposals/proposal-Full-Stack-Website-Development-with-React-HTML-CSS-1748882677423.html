        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a full-stack developer with React, and especially someone who can handle API integration. That's often where things get interesting, isn't it? I remember wrestling with a particularly stubborn payment gateway integration a while back – turned out to be a tiny typo in the API key that took me half a day to find!

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into the API documentation you're using. Then, I'd focus on building the React components with clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance and testing. Finally, thorough testing across different browsers to ensure a consistent experience.

I'm keen to learn more about the specific APIs you'll be working with. Feel free to reach out – happy to chat about the details and see if I'm a good fit for your project.</div>
