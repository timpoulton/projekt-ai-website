        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my Upwork proposal:

"Saw you're looking for someone to take ownership of your digital marketing strategy for your merchant services company â€“ no hand-holding needed. I get it.

Years ago, I worked with a similar company struggling with their website. They had a beautiful site, but it was essentially an online brochure. No calls to action, no lead magnets, nothing to convert visitors. We started with the basics, and it made a huge difference.

For you, I'd suggest first doing a thorough audit of your current website, identifying opportunities for SEO and conversion optimization. Then, based on that, creating those targeted, SEO-optimized landing pages you mentioned to capture leads. Finally, structuring some initial PPC campaigns focused on high-intent keywords related to credit card processing.

Would love to chat more about your specific challenges and ideas. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week."</div>
