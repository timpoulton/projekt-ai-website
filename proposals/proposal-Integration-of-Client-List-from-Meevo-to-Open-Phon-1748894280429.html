        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" â€“ I hear you loud and clear. Data wrangling between platforms can be a real headache. I actually spent a week last year wrestling with a similar Meevo integration for a salon that was switching CRMs, and turns out, a tiny API key was the culprit. Drove me nuts!

For your project, I'd first map out the specific data fields we need to transfer from Meevo to Open Phone. Then, I'd set up a secure connection between the two platforms, probably via their APIs. Finally, we'd run thorough tests to ensure all the contact info lands where it's supposed to, and in the right format.

If you're open to a quick chat, I'd love to hear a bit more about your Meevo setup and Open Phone configuration. No pressure either way!</div>
