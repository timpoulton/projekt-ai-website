        <p>My client has a Ferry Booking system (via custom API - no documentatiion. I will act as middleman). We tried to implement the query & booking & payment system. While doing so, unfortunately the developer is no longer available to complete the work. So we need to re-implement the frontend again with the updates (without changing a dot (client is very strict on exact frontend)).
Current setup is pure HTML pages. You will need to work on HTML pages and JavaScript only... Like I said, client is very...</p>

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt:

Hey there,

"Need to re-implement the frontend again...client is very strict on exact frontend" - I definitely understand the need to respect an existing, visually-defined product! I once spent a week recreating a specific font rendering bug for a client because *removing* it was a deal-breaker for them.

For this ferry booking system, I'd start by thoroughly reverse-engineering the existing HTML and Javascript to fully understand the interactions. Then, working closely with you as the middleman, implement the necessary updates while *exactly* preserving the current look and feel. After that, rigorous testing across different browsers to ensure pixel-perfect parity.

If you think this sounds good, I'm happy to hop on a quick call to discuss the API and specific challenges in more detail.</div>
