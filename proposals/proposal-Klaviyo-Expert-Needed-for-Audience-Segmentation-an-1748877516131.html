        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Better segmenting our audience for targeted marketing efforts" – I get it. Spent a chunk of last year untangling a client’s Klaviyo setup that was basically sending the wrong promotions to the wrong people, and it was a mess! We ended up finding almost half their list was completely miscategorized.

To help you, I'd start by diving into your existing customer data to identify key segments based on purchase history and behavior. Then, we’d refine your current flows to personalize messaging for those segments. Finally, I’d implement a cleanup strategy (potentially using double opt-in for new subscribers) to boost list health.

Would love to chat more about how I can help you get your Klaviyo shipshape!</div>
