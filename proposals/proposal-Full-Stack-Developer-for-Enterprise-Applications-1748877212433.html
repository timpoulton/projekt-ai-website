        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Seeking an experienced full stack developer to create robust enterprise applications..." and focusing on automating manual processes? I get it. I remember wrestling with a similar problem for a logistics company a few years back. They were drowning in spreadsheets. The turning point was mapping out their data flow visually before writing a single line of code - really helped identify the bottlenecks.

For your project, Iâ€™d suggest first diving into your existing workflows to pinpoint the areas that are eating up the most time. Then, we could prioritize those areas for automation and develop custom solutions for them. Finally, thorough testing will be crucial.

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and see if my experience aligns. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
