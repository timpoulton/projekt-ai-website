        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking to continue development of your n8n workflow for restaurant automation and are facing some integration challenges. I've definitely been there! Just last month I spent a week wrestling with a clunky legacy POS system that refused to play nice with a new inventory management tool. It taught me a lot about creative workarounds and the importance of thoroughly testing each integration point.

To help you get back on track, I'd suggest first taking a deep dive into your existing workflow to identify any bottlenecks, then map out a clear integration strategy for each tool based on your restaurant's unique processes, and finally, rigorously test each integration to ensure smooth data flow.

Would love to chat briefly about the specific tools you're working with and see if my experience might be a good fit for your needs.</div>
