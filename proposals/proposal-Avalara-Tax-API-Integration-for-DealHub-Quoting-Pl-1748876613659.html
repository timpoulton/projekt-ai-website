        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are seeking an experienced developer or integration specialist to implement a middleware-based integration between Avalaraâ€™s tax calculation API and the DealHub quoting platform. The goal is to automate accurate local and state sales tax calculations for product estimates generated within DealHub, using client location data as a trigger.

This project will be executed in phases, with a clear architecture already defined in collaboration with Avalara and DealHub technical teams.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's the proposal:

Hi there,

Saw you're looking to ditch those manual processes and automate tax calculations in DealHub with Avalara. I get it â€“ I spent a week untangling a similar mess for a client last year, where inaccurate tax calculations were causing major headaches with compliance.

Hereâ€™s how I see tackling this: First, Iâ€™d dive deep into the defined architecture you've got with Avalara and DealHub. Then, build that middleware integration â€“ testing constantly to ensure it's rock-solid and accurately pulling client location data. Finally, robust user acceptance testing to ensure a smooth rollout and no surprises.

If you think this approach aligns with your vision, I'd be happy to chat more about the specifics and answer any questions you have.</div>
