        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hi there! 

I’m looking for a developer who can help me build a mobile strategy game (for both Android and iOS) similar to Clash of Clans, Kingshot, Lords Mobile, and other games in that style.

My idea is to start by purchasing an existing Unity-based game template or source code and then customize and build upon it to create something unique.

The game should include core features common to this genre, such as:
	•	Base building and resource management (gold, wood, elixir, etc.)
	•	PvE missions...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're aiming to customize a Unity template for your base-building game – smart move! I’ve been down that road a few times. One project involved tweaking a similar template, and honestly, getting the resource balancing right was a real challenge initially; almost broke the gameplay loop!

For your project, I’d suggest starting with a deep dive into a few template options to nail down the perfect fit, then we’d focus on customizing those core features, like the resource management, to ensure they are rock solid from the get-go. PvE missions could then be integrated and tested to ensure they align with the core game loop.

If you’d like to chat more about your specific vision and how we could tackle this, I'm happy to hop on a quick call.</div>
