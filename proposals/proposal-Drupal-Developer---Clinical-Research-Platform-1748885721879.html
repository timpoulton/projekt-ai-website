        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about your clinical research platform and the need to manage group/patient data with Drupal 10, Domains, Groups, etc. really resonated with me. I remember working on a similar project a few years back where the biggest hurdle was getting different Drupal modules to play nicely together with user roles. Took a bit of digging, but we eventually cracked it by building some custom bridges to ensure data flowed smoothly.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your existing module setup to identify any potential conflicts, then build out those custom integrations for seamless data management, and finally thoroughly testing the workflows.

Interested in chatting more about the specific challenges you're facing? I'm happy to hop on a quick call to brainstorm.</div>
