        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Regarding "manual processes" slowing things down, I totally get it. I remember helping a small logistics company that was drowning in paperwork before we automated their device enrollment – the change was night and day for them.

For your Zoho MDM setup, I'd start by diving deep into your specific needs and current workflows to identify key areas for automation. Then, I'd configure the MDM with tailored workflows and SLA parameters to streamline operations. Finally, I’d provide documentation and training so your team can manage it effectively long term.

If this approach resonates, I'd be happy to chat more about the specifics and how I can bring some real efficiency to your mobile device management.</div>
