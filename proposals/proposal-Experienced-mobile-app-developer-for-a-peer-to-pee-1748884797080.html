        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" definitely resonated with me. I've seen firsthand how soul-crushing those can be â€“ years ago, I helped a small logistics company automate their dispatch system, and the initial relief on the operations manager's face was priceless.

For your parking app, I'd envision starting with a deep dive into the user flows to pinpoint exactly where automation can create the most value. Then, we could build out the core booking and payment functionalities with Stripe integration, and finally look at tightening the screws on admin tasks through dashboard automation.

Would love to chat more about the specific parking-related challenges and opportunities you see. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
