        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I noticed you mentioned "taking your workation company to the next level" while juggling both B2B and B2C, which can definitely stretch resources. I remember early on in my freelancing, trying to manage social media manually for a client while onboarding new customers – felt like I was constantly playing catch-up!

To help streamline things, I’d suggest focusing on: 1) identifying a few key processes that eat up the most time (lead nurturing, content scheduling?), 2) exploring simple automation tools to handle those repetitive tasks, and 3) creating a scalable content creation and distribution strategy.

It'd be great to chat more about your specific workflow and see if some smarter automation could free you up to focus on the bigger picture. Let me know if you’re open to a quick call.</div>
