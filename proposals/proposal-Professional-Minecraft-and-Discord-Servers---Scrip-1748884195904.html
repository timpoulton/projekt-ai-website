        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Fully customized Minecraft or Discord servers" – that really caught my eye. I spent a good chunk of last year helping a small gaming community build a truly unique economy system within their Discord. We hit some snags integrating it with their existing bot structure; taught me a lot about anticipating compatibility issues upfront.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a detailed requirements doc based on your vision, then moving onto a modular plugin/script build with regular check-ins so we can adapt as we go, and finally a thorough testing phase to iron out any kinks. This helps keep things flexible and collaborative.

If that sounds like a reasonable approach, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to chat about the specifics.</div>
