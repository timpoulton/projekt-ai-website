        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"We do not believe [our Laravel team] has the techni..." I hear you. I've been in similar situations â€“ once had a client where the data layer was a complete bottleneck, and it turned out the database design was fundamentally flawed. A few key architectural changes saved them weeks of headaches.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a code review focusing on architectural decisions. Then, a quick sprint to identify any immediate performance bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. Finally, we could workshop some best practices and potential improvements to ensure a scalable and maintainable foundation.

Would love to chat briefly about the specifics of your application and see if my experience aligns with what you need. Available for a quick call this week?</div>
