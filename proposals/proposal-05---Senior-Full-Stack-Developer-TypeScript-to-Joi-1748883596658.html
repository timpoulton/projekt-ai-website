        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to lead your dev team and ensure "technical standards are met, best practices are followed." That focus on standards really resonated with me. Early in my freelancing career, I worked on a project where we prioritized speed over everything else. The result? A mountain of technical debt and endless debugging later on. Lesson learned!

To help you avoid similar pitfalls, I'd focus on first establishing clear coding standards with the team, then implementing automated testing and linting tools to catch issues early. Finally, regular code reviews become essential.

If you'd like to chat about how to make that happen, I'm happy to jump on a quick call.</div>
