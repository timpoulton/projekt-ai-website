        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Automation needs" jumped out at me in your description. I've seen firsthand how daunting scaling outreach can be without the right setup. A few years ago, I worked with a small marketing agency that was drowning in manual LinkedIn outreach. We streamlined everything using a mix of Sales Navigator and a clever Zapier integration, and it completely freed up their team to focus on building relationships.

For your SaaS product, I'd start with mapping out your ideal customer profile in detail. Then, craft hyper-personalized email and LinkedIn connection sequences tailored to their specific pain points. Finally, we can integrate everything into a single dashboard for easy monitoring and adjustment.

Happy to chat more about how this could work for you.</div>
