        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I read that you're looking for someone to develop new features and fix bugs for your web application. That's music to my ears!

I spent the last year helping a local startup streamline their e-commerce platform. They were drowning in support tickets because of a clunky checkout process. Turns out, a simple UI/UX overhaul and some database optimization made a huge difference.

For your project, I’d suggest we start by: 1) Deep diving into the existing codebase and architecture to understand the current state. 2) Prioritizing the most impactful feature enhancements and bug fixes based on user feedback (if you have it). 3) Building a plan for consistent monitoring and performance tuning going forward.

If you're open to a quick chat to discuss your vision in more detail, I’d love to hear more.</div>
