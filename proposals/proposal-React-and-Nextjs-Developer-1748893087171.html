        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a React/Next.js developer to join your remote team. "Full-time" and "long-term" sound great!

I've been automating processes and building web apps for about 20 years, and recently, I had a client who was spending hours manually updating inventory. We used Next.js for the frontend and a small .NET Core API for the backend, and it saved them a ton of time. It made me realize how powerful those combinations could be.

Based on your description, I think focusing on a solid, scalable React component library, followed by clean API integrations, and then optimizing for performance with Next.js would be a good approach.

I'd love to chat more about your project. Are you free for a quick call next week?</div>
