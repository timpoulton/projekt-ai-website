        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Automations to trigger and send Emails and notifications for all the usual commerce events" - I get it. The manual process of keeping track of everything in an e-commerce business is a nightmare!

I remember helping a small online bookstore a few years ago. They were manually pulling sales data from WooCommerce into a spreadsheet every week. We set up a Zapier integration that automated the process, and they freed up hours each week.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with mapping out your current workflows and identifying the key data points you want to track. Then, we can design the Zaps to connect WooCommerce, ActiveCampaign, and your internal reporting channels. Finally, we'll implement the webhooks and API integrations needed for those events and notifications.

Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss your specific needs? No pressure, just want to make sure I'm the right fit.</div>
