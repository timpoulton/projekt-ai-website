        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Removing any redundant roles to maximize team productivity" – I totally get it. I've seen ClickUp setups turn into digital spaghetti when roles aren't clearly defined. Once helped a startup where three people were doing essentially the same task; sorting that out doubled their output almost overnight.

For your situation, I'd start by auditing your current ClickUp setup to map out existing roles and workflows. Then, we can collaboratively refine those workflows to eliminate redundancies. Finally, I'd focus on the best way to assign tasks to your team members for optimal productivity.

Would be happy to hop on a quick call to discuss your requirements in more detail!</div>
