        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I have an existing excell spreadsheet with formulas which I took from the internet. I ran it through Chat GPT with specific queries but it still isn't correct. Some formulas need to be reviewed and reworked. The formatting needs to be redone to provide consistency. We will be using this as a template</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I read your description about your Excel spreadsheet feeling "not correct" after running it through ChatGPT. I completely understand the frustration.

I actually just helped a small non-profit whose donor database was a similar jumbled mess of internet formulas. We spent hours cleaning it up.

For your spreadsheet, I'd suggest first walking through each of the formulas to find the source of the errors. I could then rework them to align with your data. Finally, I'd ensure consistent formatting that makes the template usable.

Let me know if you would like to chat about the details of the formulas and data you are using. I'm happy to jump on a quick call to discuss.</div>
