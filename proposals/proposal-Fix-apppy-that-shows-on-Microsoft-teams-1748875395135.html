        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hello, 

this is a very simple project I have an app. Py file that takes information from another file and return it as a display on Microsoft teams what I need is two things first thing is to delete I duplicate it line that appears twice and the second thing is to make the answer show up as talking by talking instead of one block of answer on teams.

The app uses flask and python.

Before accepting this project please you must be able to do this project very fast and already know how to solve t...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Duplicate line appearing twice" and wanting it to "show up talking by talking" on Teams â€“ I get it. I actually spent a good chunk of last year untangling a similar display issue with a Flask app pushing data to Slack. Turns out, a rogue caching issue was the culprit!

For your situation, I'd first pinpoint exactly *where* that duplicate line is being generated in your `app.py`. Then, we'll rewrite the display logic to stream the responses in segments, instead of one block. Finally, we'll test it directly on Teams to make sure it's showing as you want.

If this makes sense to you and you're up for a quick chat about the code, let me know. I'm usually pretty quick on these smaller fixes.</div>
