        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking for a developer to help build an MVP for a mobile habit-forming app. The app should be clean, modern, and user-friendly—visually appealing but minimal, with no fluff. It will include preset daily and weekly challenges across different categories, with the ability for users to create their own custom challenges (if they subscribe to the top tier).

The app needs to include basic gamification features, including XP, streaks, and progress tracking. There will also be a lightweight socia...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for a dev to build an MVP for your habit-tracking app with gamification – especially with the preset challenges and custom challenges for the top tier. That detail about subscriptions unlocking the custom challenges? Smart move for monetization.

I remember years ago, automating a lead-gen system where that tiered access model was crucial. Initially, free users complained about limitations, but the conversion to paid once they experienced the basic value was significant. The key was making the free features *good* and the paid features *obviously better*.

For your app, I'd suggest focusing first on nailing the core habit tracking with basic gamification features. Once that’s solid, we could then concentrate on the subscription model and the custom challenges, integrating them smoothly without disrupting the user experience. Then, finally we'd look at the social integration.

I’d love to chat more about your vision for the app. Shoot me a message if you're interested!</div>
