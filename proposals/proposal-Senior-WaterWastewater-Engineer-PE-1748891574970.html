        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw your note about wanting expertise that directly shapes innovative solutions – that resonates with me. I’ve spent a lot of time over the past few years helping small municipal water treatment plants integrate new SCADA systems with legacy equipment. One particularly challenging project involved a system with mismatched communication protocols; got it running smoothly eventually by creating a custom interface using Python.

For your needs, I'd start by really diving into the existing infrastructure documentation, then focusing on a phased integration, followed by rigorous testing to ensure seamless operation.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific challenges and see if my experience lines up with what you need. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week.</div>
