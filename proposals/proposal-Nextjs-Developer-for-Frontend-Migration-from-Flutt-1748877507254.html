        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're migrating travelbud.in from Flutter to Next.js – I hear you on the scalability and SEO front with Flutter web apps sometimes.

I actually helped a client a few years back who'd built a real-estate portal in Flutter, and we ended up rewriting the front-end in React for very similar reasons. The biggest thing we focused on was carefully mapping the data flow between the two platforms and establishing a very clear, documented API to make the switch seamless.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a component-by-component migration strategy. After that, we could use a staging environment to iron out any integration challenges you foresee. Finally, we can optimize the app to meet your desired SEO requirements.

Would love to chat more about your specific setup sometime this week if you're free.</div>
