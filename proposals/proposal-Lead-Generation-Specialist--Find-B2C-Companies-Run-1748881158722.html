        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking to hire a Lead Generation Expert to build a targeted list of B2C businesses that are running Facebook ads and actively generating leads. These companies will be used in outreach campaigns for an AI-powered sales automation service.

About Me:
I run a fast-growing company that helps service-based and consumer-focused businesses automate their lead follow-up and appointment setting using AI-driven tools. These include:

AI agents that reply to messages across platforms (chat, SMS, etc....</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"AI agents that reply to messages across platforms" – that's exactly where so many businesses struggle! I was just talking to a landscaping company last week dealing with the same thing. They were drowning in appointment requests and losing leads.

Finding those specific B2C companies actively using Facebook ads for lead gen is definitely doable. My approach would be to first, pinpoint relevant ad libraries based on keywords related to your AI service's target users (e.g., "online booking for salons"). Then, I'd use a combination of scraping tools and manual validation to gather their contact information (and verify it's actually working!). Finally, I'd consolidate everything into a clean, usable spreadsheet.

Would be happy to chat more about how to refine that process for your specific needs. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
