        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We're TymFlo, a marketing automation agency struggling with conversion rates despite good website traffic. Our analytics show a high bounce rate  and visitors aren't moving from awareness to purchase.

The Problem:
Our current homepage and landing pages fail to clearly communicate the specific problems we solve for clients. We need copy that creates what writing expert Larry McEnerney calls "instability" - helping visitors recognize their problems and positioning our solutions as valuable.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey TymFlo team,

That "instability" concept McEnerney talks about is spot on – I've seen firsthand how crucial it is to make people *feel* the problem before they're ready to hear the solution. It’s easy to get caught up in features and miss that key step.

For your homepage, I’d suggest starting with a deeper dive into understanding your ideal client’s day-to-day frustrations with manual processes – the tedious stuff *they* actually complain about. From there, we can craft copy that reflects those pain points back to them in their own words, then subtly position your services as the clear path forward. Finally, we will ensure a clear call to action.

Would love to chat briefly about those frustrations you're seeing, and how we can turn them into conversion gold.</div>
