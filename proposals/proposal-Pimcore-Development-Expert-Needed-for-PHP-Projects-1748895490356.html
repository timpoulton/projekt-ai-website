        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I read you're looking to enhance your customer MDM system with Pimcore and PHP, and that you're hoping to address some manual processes. That immediately caught my eye.

A few years back, I worked on a similar MDM project where data entry was a real bottleneck. We initially focused on optimizing the Pimcore data import routines, and it freed up about a day a week for the team, which let them focus on far more valuable activities.

For your project, I'd suggest first taking a look at your current Pimcore setup to identify the biggest time sinks. Then, we could prioritize automating those key workflows through custom PHP integrations. Finally, thorough testing is crucial before deployment.

Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss the specifics of your manual processes and see if my approach aligns with your needs? No pressure either way.</div>
