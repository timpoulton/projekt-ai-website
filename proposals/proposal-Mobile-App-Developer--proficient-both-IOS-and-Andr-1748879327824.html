        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to "fix bugs and other performance issues" and generally improve the app. Been there! I remember one time, a tiny, almost invisible memory leak was driving users crazy. Turns out, it was a poorly optimized image caching function. Little gremlins, those things.

For this, I'd start with a deep dive into your app's analytics and crash reports to identify the biggest friction points. Then, I'd implement a rigorous testing and debugging cycle, working closely with you on design improvements. Finally, I can handle writing the executables so that everything flows.

If you're open to chatting more about your mobile app, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your overall vision and goals for the app.</div>
