        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking to enhance security for your cloud-native apps and especially keen to address those manual processes. I get it! I recently worked on a project where the manual security checks in the CI/CD pipeline were a total bottleneck, adding weeks to deployments.

For your situation, I'd suggest starting with a quick audit of your current Azure security setup and IaC practices to pinpoint those bottlenecks. Then, we can look at automating key security checks within the CI/CD pipeline â€“ focusing on OWASP top 10 and API security using DAST. Finally, we can integrate these findings into your SOC 2 compliance efforts.

I'd love to chat more about your specific application architecture and see how my experience in Azure security can help. Let me know if you're open to a quick call.</div>
