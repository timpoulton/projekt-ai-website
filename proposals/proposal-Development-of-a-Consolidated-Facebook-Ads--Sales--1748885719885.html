        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're wrestling with consolidating data from a bunch of Facebook Business Managers and Ad Accounts ‚Äì "manual processes" definitely jumped out at me. I've been there! I remember one client, a small e-commerce shop, who was spending almost a full day each week just piecing together reports.

For your situation, I'd suggest first mapping out exactly what data points are most crucial from each BM and ad account. Then, I can build a custom script to pull that data into a single, manageable spreadsheet or database. Finally, we can explore options for automating this on a schedule that fits your needs.

Would be happy to chat about the specifics and see if my approach aligns with what you're looking for. Let me know if you're up for a quick call.</div>
