        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are building an open-source collection of modular Python-based microservices (called MCP servers) that communicate via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each server exposes a public HTTP API and integrates with external data sources (e.g., arXiv, YouTube, Tavily).

Our public repository is available via this link:
https://github.com/Xyber-Labs/mcp-servers

We’re looking for an experienced Python developer to add retry logic with exponential backoff to one of our services, specifically the arXiv serve...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Integration challenges" with external APIs, especially when data sources like arXiv are involved, I totally get that. I remember once spending a whole afternoon debugging a similar issue with a government API. Turns out their rate limiting was undocumented!

For your arXiv server, I'd suggest first diving into the current code to understand the existing API calls. Then, I'd integrate the `tenacity` library with an exponential backoff strategy specifically tailored to arXiv's rate limits (we can figure those out together). Finally, I'd add some basic logging so you can easily monitor the retries and adjust as needed.

I've had a look at your GitHub repo, and it looks like a really interesting project. I'd be happy to hop on a quick call to discuss how I can help.</div>
