        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Seamless data transfer and communication between them" â€“ that's music to my ears! I understand the frustration that comes with manually juggling data between Salesforce and Jira. I once spent a week untangling a spaghetti-like integration someone *thought* was seamless. Lesson learned: proper planning is key.

For your project, I'd start by mapping out those specific data points you need synced and the direction it should flow. Then, I'll configure the connection itself, using webhooks or middleware (depending on your preference and budget). Finally, thorough testing is crucial.

Would you be available for a quick chat to discuss your specific requirements and workflow in more detail? I'm happy to share some ideas.</div>
