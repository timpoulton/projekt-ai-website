        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to create a website and Facebook page that really reflects your publishing brand, Remlap. I get it. I once spent a week helping a friend, a fantasy author, finally nail down a website design that felt *right* for her books. It's tougher than it looks!

For Remlap, I'd start by sketching out some initial website layouts based on your brand aesthetic and target audience. Then, once we're happy with a design direction, I'd build out the website itself and create a complementary Facebook page with engaging graphics and content to draw readers in. Finally, we can test and refine based on user feedback to ensure the website converts.

Would love to chat more about Remlap Publishing and your vision for your online presence. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
