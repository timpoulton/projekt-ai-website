        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my Upwork proposal:

Hey there,

"Manual processes" - I hear you loud and clear. Iâ€™ve seen so many great ideas bogged down by that, and it's frustrating!

Years back, I helped a startup automate their user onboarding sequence, similar to what you're aiming for, and we spent a solid week *just* untangling the mess of manual email verifications. Once we automated that, the user activation rate jumped significantly.

For your AI SaaS MVP, I'd suggest: First, a thorough code review to understand the current state. Second, focus on nailing the onboarding flow with email/SSO, using Supabase for secure user management. Finally, we'll prioritize building those core AI Site Builder features based on your Figma designs.

Would love to chat more about your vision and how we can tackle those manual pain points together. Let me know when you're free for a quick call.</div>
