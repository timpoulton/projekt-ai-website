        <p>Hi,

I have existing automation flow in Make which crease Linkedin posts for me. 

I would like to expand the flow to do the following:

1) Generate image 
2) Create a random post type selector , and twice a week create different type of posts 
3) Search online for related events, and create posts related to coming event. 

I am happy to move to n8n from make. If using n8n need to host it on another service and not the n8n cloud. 

Looking for someone with experience doing this type of flows.

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking to expand your LinkedIn post automation to include image generation and event-related posts â€“ a very cool idea! I know the feeling of wanting to go beyond the basics with these flows.

I once spent a week wrestling with a similar event-based automation, only to realize the data source was riddled with errors. That taught me the importance of solid data scrubbing upfront!

To help with your expansion, I'd suggest first focusing on getting the image generation ironed out and then tackling the 'random post type selector'. Once those are solid, we can dive into sourcing event data and creating those timely posts. If n8n is the way to go, I have some experience setting up self-hosted instances that might be useful as well.

Would be happy to chat about your specific needs and see if I can help.</div>
