        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about your on-chain insurance protocol with Symbiotic, the need for streamlining really jumped out at me. I spent a good chunk of last year helping a DeFi platform move their claims process onto the chain. What surprised us was how much time we saved just by automating the validation of policyholder data. It was a game-changer.

For your project, I'd start by digging into the Symbiotic platform to see how we can leverage its features for secure and efficient claims management. Then, we can design smart contracts specifically tailored to your insurance logic. Finally, rigorous testing and security audits would be vital to ensure everything works smoothly and safely.

I'm genuinely interested in hearing more about the specific challenges you're facing. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about the possibilities!</div>
