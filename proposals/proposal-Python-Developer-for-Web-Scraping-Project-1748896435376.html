        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manually gathering and processing data," I read that and I immediately thought of a client I worked with last year. They were spending *hours* each week compiling competitor pricing. We automated that whole process, and it freed them up to focus on actual strategy â€“ it was pretty cool to see the impact.

For your project, I'd first want to dive deep into the target websites and their structure to nail down the most efficient scraping method (Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, etc.). Then, I'd build the scraper with robust error handling and data validation. Finally, we'd ensure everything is compliant with data collection guidelines - super important.

I'd love to chat more about the specifics of the sites you're targeting and how we can best extract the data you need. Feel free to reach out!</div>
