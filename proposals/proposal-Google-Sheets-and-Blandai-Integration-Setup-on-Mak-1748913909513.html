        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking to streamline data flow between Google Sheets and Bland.ai with Make.com, and that workflow optimization piece definitely caught my eye. I completely get it – I spent a frustrating week last year wrestling with a similar Sheets/Calendly integration that kept dropping data. Turns out, a tiny error in a date format was the culprit!

For your setup, I'd start by carefully mapping out the exact data points you need flowing between Sheets and Bland.ai. Then, I'd build the Make.com scenario step-by-step, focusing on solid error handling. Finally, rigorous testing with real data to catch any quirks is crucial.

Anyway, I'd be happy to chat more about your specific use case and see if my experience would be a good fit. Let me know if you’re free for a quick call.</div>
