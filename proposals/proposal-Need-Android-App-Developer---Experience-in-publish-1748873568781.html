        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to handle the Android app publishing, especially getting those two apps live on your old Play Console account. I get it â€“ the app store release process can be a real headache, especially with all the changes Google makes!

I remember once spending an entire afternoon wrestling with a particularly stubborn image asset that wouldn't resize properly for the Play Store requirements. Little things can really eat up your time.

For your project, I'd suggest first getting the icon and image changes finalized. Next, we'd tackle prepping the apps for release. Finally, I'd handle the publishing to your Play Console, making sure everything goes smoothly.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to chat more about your timeline and specific needs for those image updates. No pressure, just happy to help if I can.</div>
