        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi TruePMG team,

"Bringing structure, efficiency, and innovation to our business" – that really resonated with me. Scaling a vacation rental business is tough! I remember helping a smaller outfit in Colorado automate their guest communication a few years back. What seemed like a simple "send welcome email" ended up saving them almost 10 hours a week.

For your situation, I'm thinking we could start by: 1) identifying those repetitive tasks that are eating up your team's time; 2) prioritizing the areas where automation would have the biggest impact; and 3) building out some initial workflows to streamline those processes. We can really tailor this to your team's workflows.

Would love to chat more about your current challenges and see where I can help.

Best,
Timothy</div>
