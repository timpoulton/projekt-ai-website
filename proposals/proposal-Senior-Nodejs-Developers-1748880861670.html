        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" caught my eye. I've been there! Early in my career, I spent weeks manually deploying code, and the relief of finally automating that process was immense. Seeing you need Senior Node.js folks to build scalable APIs reminds me of a project I worked on a few years back where we tackled similar scaling issues by first mapping out the current bottlenecks, then gradually implementing automated testing and deployment pipelines.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your existing architecture, pinpointing the most time-consuming areas. Then, focusing on building automated CI/CD pipelines for those specific services. Finally, implementing robust monitoring and alerting to catch issues early.

Iâ€™d be happy to chat more about your specific backend challenges and how I can help. Let me know if you're available for a quick call.</div>
