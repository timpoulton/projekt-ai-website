        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to bring that Figma design to life on your homepage and tweak the chatbot. I've definitely been there â€“ wrestling with WordPress themes and third-party plugins to get everything just right.

Funny enough, just last week I spent way too long trying to style a chatbot integration on a client's site. Turns out, a few lines of custom CSS was all it needed in the end. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the hardest to spot!

For your project, I'd start by carefully building your Figma design in WordPress, making sure it's responsive and pixel-perfect. Then, I'd dive into that chatbot, pinpointing exactly what needs adjusting or removing. Finally, rigorous testing across devices to ensure a smooth user experience.

If you're free for a quick chat sometime this week, I'd love to hear more about the design and chatbot. Always up for a good challenge!</div>
