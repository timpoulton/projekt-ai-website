        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to streamline things between Zoho and PhoneBurner, specifically getting rid of some manual steps. That's music to my ears! I remember one time, a client was manually transferring lead data â€“ it was a *nightmare*. We automated that and they literally doubled their call volume without adding staff.

For you, I'd start by diving into your current workflow to map exactly where the data's getting stuck. Then, we'd configure the Zoho API to talk directly to PhoneBurner, setting up triggers to automate the data transfer. Finally, we can optimize everything for efficiency.

Would love to chat for a few minutes about the specifics of your current setup. No pressure, just a quick brainstorm.</div>
