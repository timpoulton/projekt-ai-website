        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" are definitely a time-suck â€“ I totally get that! I remember years back, wrestling with a clunky inventory system that was entirely manual, and the relief when I finally automated it was HUGE.

For this project, I'm thinking we could start with solidifying the MySQL database design based on your documentation, ensuring it's optimized for the API. Then, focus on building out that Go API, prioritizing speed and security for database interaction. Finally, tackle the front-end development, sticking closely to the provided UX/UI to create a user-friendly experience.

If this approach resonates, I'd love to chat more about the specifics and how my experience could bring your project to life. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
