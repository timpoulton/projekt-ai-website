        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading your description, the "organized batch label sheets" part really jumped out at me. I spent years in a similar role before specializing in automation, and I remember the daily struggle to wrangle order data into something usable for the warehouse. It’s a real time sink!

From what you've described, I'd initially focus on a two-step approach: first, automating the data extraction from Sellercloud, and then creating a standardized template (either PDF or Excel – whatever works best for your warehouse team) for those label sheets. It's about streamlining that daily process.

If this sounds promising, I'd love to chat for a few minutes to understand your current setup better and see how I can help. No pressure at all.</div>
