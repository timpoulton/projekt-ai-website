        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading your description, especially where you mention needing help with course creation and management inside Kajabi, really resonated with me. I remember a similar situation a few years back with a client selling photography courses. They were drowning in manual enrollment and payment tracking.

Based on your needs, my initial approach would be to first get a handle on your existing Kajabi setup. Then, we could map out the student journey from signup to completion, pinpointing areas for automation. Finally, I'd focus on integrating your payment gateways and setting up automated email sequences to nurture student engagement.

Would be happy to chat more about the specifics of your courses and see how I can help streamline things. Feel free to schedule a quick call!</div>
