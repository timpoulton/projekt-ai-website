        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Need someone who can handle the full backend..." I get it. Launching a course is exciting, but wrestling with Kajabi to make everything *actually* work can steal all the joy. I remember helping a friend launch her photography course last year, and we spent a solid week just troubleshooting a wonky Zapier connection between Kajabi and her CRM – it was painful!

For your project, I'd first focus on crafting a branded course structure that truly reflects your client's vision. Then, I'd build out those crucial sales and landing pages with conversion in mind, making sure all the integrations (emails, SMS, payment) are seamless. Finally, I would handle the content uploading and optimize the student experience.

If you'd like to chat briefly about how I can help take the tech burden off your plate, let me know. I am excited to see your course thrive.</div>
