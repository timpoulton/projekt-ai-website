        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Solving critical workflow problems" in insurance â€“ that really resonates with me. I spent a chunk of last year untangling a particularly messy claims processing system for a small brokerage; the bottleneck was surprising, but it came down to a simple data entry issue, which, once automated, freed up their team immensely.

For your AI platform, I'd suggest first focusing on a deep dive into the *specific* workflows in health and P&C you want to address. Then, build a modular AI design so it can be adapted for different companies or products to gain quick access to markets. Finally, a detailed strategy for marketing the platform.

If you think this approach aligns with your vision, I'd be happy to chat more about the nitty-gritty.</div>
