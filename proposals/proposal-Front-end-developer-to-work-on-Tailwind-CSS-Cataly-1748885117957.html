        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to integrate Catalyst into your Next.js dashboard and specifically mentioned some potential integration challenges. I get it! I've been there. A few years back, I spent a week banging my head against a similar UI kit that just refused to play nicely with an existing component library. Turns out, a seemingly minor CSS specificity conflict was the culprit.

My approach to this would be: first, do a thorough audit of your current components to map out exactly what needs replacing. Then, I'd create a separate branch to install Catalyst and start rebuilding those key pages you mentioned (dashboard, settings, modals) one at a time. Finally, comprehensive responsiveness and accessibility testing to make sure everything is rock solid.

Would love to chat more about your project and how I can help make this integration as smooth as possible.</div>
