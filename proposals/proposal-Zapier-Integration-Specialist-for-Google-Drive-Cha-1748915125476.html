        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to smooth out the workflow between Google Drive, ChatGPT, and Trello â€“ especially aiming for efficient data flow. I get that. I actually helped a buddy of mine, a freelance writer, set up a similar system. He was constantly copying and pasting content, and it was eating up his whole morning.

For your setup, I'd start by mapping out the exact data you need flowing between each platform. Then, we can build the Zaps step-by-step, testing each one rigorously along the way to catch any hiccups early. Finally, we could look at some optimization strategies based on how you actually *use* the integrated system.

If this sounds like the kind of approach you're looking for, I'd be happy to chat for a few minutes about your specific needs.</div>
