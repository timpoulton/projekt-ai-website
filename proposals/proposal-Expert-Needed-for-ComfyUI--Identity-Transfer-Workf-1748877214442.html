        <p>Need Expert for ComfyUI + InstantID + IP-Adapter + ControlNet Workflow – Realistic Face Identity Transfer Setup

Description:
I’m working on a project that involves realistic identity transfer between two photos for internal testing of image verification systems (e.g., KYC automation, photo-matching reliability, identity consistency checks).

I need someone experienced in ComfyUI, InstantID, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet (Inpaint) to help me set up and execute the following workflow:

Hey there,

"Manual processes" always scream "opportunity" to me! I totally get the desire to automate image verification – spent a good chunk of last year wrestling with similar identity consistency challenges for a facial recognition system used in secure access control. Learned a *lot* about finetuning these transfer workflows.

For your ComfyUI setup, I’d suggest first tackling the core InstantID + IP-Adapter integration, then layering in ControlNet Inpaint specifically for those tricky areas that need cleaner transitions. Finally, we can test and iterate on that workflow to improve fidelity using the "identity consistency checks" you mentioned.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to talk through the specifics of your data and how we can dial in the realism you're looking for. Let me know!
