        <p>Developer Needed for AI Betting/Trading BotWe're looking for a developer to build a web-based platform combining automated trading and betting with AI. The platform will use over ten years of horse racing data along with existing algorithms we've developed.

You should have experience building systems that interact with betting exchanges, specifically Betfair or Matchbook. You’ll need to be confident working with APIs for data feeds, pricing, and placing bets. A strong grasp of machine learning ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Combining automated trading and betting with AI" – that sounds fascinating! I remember years ago, trying to build a similar system for a smaller, more niche sports market. The biggest hurdle was always real-time data reliability; a delayed feed could completely wreck the strategy.

For your project, I'd suggest initially focusing on connecting and validating the Betfair/Matchbook APIs. Then, we could integrate your existing algorithms with that live data to test their effectiveness in a real-time environment. Finally, we can implement the AI component in a scalable and modular way.

I'd love to chat about your specific data sources and algorithm structure. Maybe we can brainstorm some approaches. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
