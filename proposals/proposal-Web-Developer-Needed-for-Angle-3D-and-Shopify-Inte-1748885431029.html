        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about the Angle-3D and Shopify integration, I immediately understand the need for seamless functionality. I remember struggling with a similar 3D configurator integration a few years back - it turned out a simple CSS conflict was causing all sorts of headaches! Took ages to trace, but it highlights the importance of meticulous front-end work.

For your project, I'd suggest a phased approach: first, a deep dive into the existing CSS and Liquid files to identify potential conflicts, followed by incremental integration and testing with Angle-3D, and finally, a round of refinement to ensure optimal performance and visual appeal on all devices.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to chat more about your specific needs and the details of the integration. I'm happy to brainstorm further.</div>
