        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey! Saw you're looking for someone to "connect APIs" with Swift, and that you're keen on good vibes - love that.

I remember when I first automated a data pipeline for a small e-commerce business, the feeling of relief when they finally ditched their manual spreadsheet updates was infectious.

With your project, I'd suggest starting with a quick discovery call to really nail down the API specifics. Then, I'd build a small prototype to ensure smooth data flow, followed by rigorous testing and implementation. I am sure we can find the best way to ensure that there is seamless automation.

It sounds like an interesting project, and I'm always up for a chat. Let me know if you’re free sometime this week.</div>
