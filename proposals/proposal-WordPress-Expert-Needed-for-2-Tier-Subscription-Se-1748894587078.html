        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for someone to tackle the 2-tier subscription setup and Brevo integration on your sustainability website. I know those integrations can sometimes be trickier than they seem!

A few years back, I spent a solid week troubleshooting a similar setup for a local non-profit, turns out the issue was just a tiny setting buried deep within the plugin. Things like that are just part of the game.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to: 1) carefully evaluate your current WordPress setup, 2) recommend a subscription plugin that plays nicely with Brevo, and 3) handle the full integration to ensure a seamless user experience.

If that sounds like a good starting point, feel free to send me a message. I'm happy to chat more about your specific needs.</div>
