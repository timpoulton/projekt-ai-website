        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Turning loose ideas into systems" - that really resonated with me. I've spent the last few years helping solo founders and small teams wrangle exactly that kind of chaos into something manageable through automation. I remember once helping a founder who was spending *hours* each week just copy-pasting data between spreadsheets and their CRM; we streamlined it with a simple Zapier integration and gave them back almost a full day.

For Tocco, especially with the emphasis on content and ops, I'd think about initially mapping out your key workflows, identifying the repetitive tasks, and then building out lightweight automations to handle them. Maybe starting with lead qualification or content distribution?

Would love to chat more about your specific pain points and explore some quick wins. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
