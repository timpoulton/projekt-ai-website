        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" â€“ I hear you loud and clear! I've been there. I remember one project where a client was manually syncing data between their CRM and email marketing platform, literally spending hours a week on copy-pasting. After automating the sync with a custom API integration, the founder bought me a beer every Friday for a month. No joke.

For your AI SaaS application, I'd start by diving deep into the existing codebase and architecture, especially around your AI/NLP integrations. Then, we can prioritize feature development based on impact and build scalable, well-designed front-end components in Next.js. And finally, make sure the MongoDB backend can handle the increased load.

Would love to chat more about the specific challenges you're facing and how my experience with similar stacks could help. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
