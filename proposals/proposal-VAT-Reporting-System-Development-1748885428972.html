        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"I understand the biggest headache is the manual VAT reporting process – trust me, I’ve seen it firsthand. Early in my career, I spent weeks untangling a client's spreadsheets and realized there had to be a better way!

For your project, I'd start by mapping out the entire data flow, focusing on automating document extraction and validation. Then, I'd build the core reporting logic leveraging open-source libraries for a clean, customizable dashboard. Finally, we'd integrate security measures and thorough testing before deploying.

Does this sound like a reasonable approach? I'd be happy to chat further about your specific requirements and explore some potential tech stacks. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week."</div>
