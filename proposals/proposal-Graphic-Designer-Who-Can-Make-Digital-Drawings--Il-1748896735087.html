        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading your post about needing design work for both Instagram and your website struck a chord. I've seen firsthand how powerful consistent branding can be for businesses, especially when driving customer action.

Years ago, I worked with a local cafe that struggled to get online reviews. After setting up a similar QR code system, the real hurdle became crafting eye-catching graphics for the table tents and social media. What really worked was showcasing customer reviews directly within the imagery.

For your project, I'd envision starting by understanding your current brand guidelines, then concepting a series of digital and print ads that incorporate your key messaging and customer feedback. After that, we can refine the winning designs and optimize for each platform.

If this approach resonates, I'd love to chat more about your specific needs and vision.</div>
