        <p>I run a fashion e-commerce store built with WordPress and WooCommerce, hosted on IONOS. The site is styled to resemble Zara and needs to be finalized.
Most work was previously done, but due to a backup issue, progress after May 5 has been lost. I’ve restored images, but updates completed up to May 30, including product descriptions, checkout flow, and static pages wich must be redone.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Progress after May 5 has been lost…updates completed up to May 30...must be redone." Ouch, that's a tough spot! I had a similar issue once with a client migrating to a new server – lost a ton of custom CSS changes right before launch. Learned my lesson about offsite backups *real* quick!

Looking at your situation, I'd tackle it in three stages: first, a careful review of your video to get a clear picture of the lost work. Second, systematically rebuild the content, checkout flow, and static pages. Finally, thorough testing to ensure everything's running smoothly before you go live again.

Would you be open to a quick chat so I can better understand your vision for the site? I can take a look at the recording and give you an idea of timeline and pricing.</div>
