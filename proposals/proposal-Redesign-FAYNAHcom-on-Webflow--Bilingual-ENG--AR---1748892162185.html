        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hello!
I’m looking for a Webflow expert to help redesign our company website faynah.com, a home styling and interior design business.

We have already selected a Webflow template will be provided upon interview

✅ Tasks:

Import and set up the selected Webflow template

Customize the design and layout to match our brand (we will provide logo, colors, fonts, and reference images)

Set up a bilingual website (English + [insert second language, e.g., Arabic or French]) — either with a toggle switch...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt:

"Hello! I saw you're looking for help with redesigning faynah.com in Webflow, and particularly noted the 'integration challenges' you're anticipating.

Funny enough, just last week I spent longer than I'd like to admit wrestling with getting a client's custom form to play nice with their CRM on Webflow. Turns out a tiny, overlooked Javascript conflict was the culprit! It taught me to always double-check even the seemingly simple things.

For your project, I'd start by carefully importing and customizing the template with your branding assets. Then, I'd tackle the bilingual setup, ensuring a smooth user experience with that toggle switch. Finally, I'd focus on the Perfex CRM integration, meticulously testing the connection to avoid those unexpected hiccups.

If you're open to chatting more about your vision for faynah.com and those integration concerns, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call. No pressure at all, just a chance to see if my experience aligns well with your needs."</div>
