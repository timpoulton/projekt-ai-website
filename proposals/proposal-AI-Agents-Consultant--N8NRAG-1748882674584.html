        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" jumped out at me. I totally get it. I was once wrestling with a clunky Zapier setup for a marketing agency, trying to wrangle lead data. It felt like herding cats!

For your content automation engine, especially in the dynamic world of MENA startups and VC, I think we could start by solidifying the RAG architecture. First, ensuring we are feeding the AI agents the most relevant knowledge base. Secondly, mapping out the key N8N workflows – focusing on the biggest content bottlenecks. Finally, making sure we have a solid monitoring strategy in place, as that's an aspect often overlooked.

I'd be happy to chat more about how to fine-tune this and what potential stumbling blocks to look out for. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
