        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Phung Anh Vinh,

The need for *low-cost* IoT solutions for agriculture definitely resonated with me. I've seen first-hand how expensive some of these systems can be, putting them out of reach for many smaller farms and businesses.

A few years back, I worked on a project automating a small hydroponics operation, and the biggest hurdle was always finding affordable sensors and actuators.

Regarding your EB-2 NIW petition, I'd be happy to help in any way I can. Given your focus and ProfVal support, it feels like the first step would be to refine your business plan, maybe highlighting the innovative aspects that address the need for cost reduction specifically. Then, we could see how best to tie in your impactful projects as examples of your solution.

Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss how I can assist you?</div>
