        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading about your need to zone the office layout and create a more productive space really resonated. I remember helping a small marketing agency a few years back that had a similar issue – constant interruptions were killing their workflow. Just a simple reorganization of desks based on task type made a huge difference.

For your project, I’d suggest starting with a detailed needs assessment of each department, mapping their workflows and collaboration patterns. Then, we can explore different zoning options, focusing on minimizing distractions and maximizing team synergy. Finally, high-quality visualizations will let you see the space come to life and get feedback before any walls are moved!

I'd be happy to chat more about your specific vision for the redesign and how I can help bring it to life. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
