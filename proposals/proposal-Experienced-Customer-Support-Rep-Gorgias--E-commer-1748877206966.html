        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone who can do more than just answer tickets and help optimize support systems, and that really resonated with me. Iâ€™ve spent a good chunk of my time as an automation specialist untangling manual processes for businesses. I remember working with a skincare company struggling to manage inquiries â€“ we streamlined their order tracking responses using a little Gorgias magic, freeing them to focus on, you know, actually *selling* skincare.

For you, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your current Gorgias setup, mapping out common inquiry types to pinpoint automation opportunities. Then, we could prioritize building out automated workflows (order status, returns, etc.) based on frequency and impact. Finally, we'd look at integrating data from your e-commerce platform for truly personalized responses.

Happy to chat more about your specific needs and see if my experience aligns. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
