        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Left incomplete" and needing someone to "take ownership"... I've definitely been there, inheriting projects that just need a solid push across the finish line. A few years back, I inherited an automation setup using Zapier and Instagram; turns out the original freelancer hadn't accounted for Instagram's rate limits, so the whole thing kept crashing. Learned a valuable lesson about thorough testing that day!

For your project, I'd first audit the existing setup, identifying the sticking points. Then, I'd focus on fine-tuning the targeting parameters to ensure we're reaching the right leads, followed by rigorous testing of the automation to avoid any unforeseen hiccups.

Let me know if you’d like to chat about your current setup and the best approach for moving forward.</div>
