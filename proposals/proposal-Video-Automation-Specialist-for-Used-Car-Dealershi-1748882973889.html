        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Seamless video retrieval and delivery" – I hear you on that. I've seen a lot of automation projects grind to a halt because the final handoff felt clunky. Once built a system for a real estate firm where the sales team *loved* the automated brochures, but hated the 5-step process to actually get them to clients. It was faster to do it manually!

For your dealership, I'd first focus on a tight API integration between your CRM, Google Drive, and ElevenLabs. Then, develop a script-based video assembly process, keeping that natural background audio intact like you mentioned. Finally, we'd automate the retrieval of the completed videos, likely via a shared Drive folder setup with clear naming conventions linked to the CRM.

Does this resonate? I'm happy to chat more about the practicalities and how we can sidestep the usual workflow bottlenecks.</div>
