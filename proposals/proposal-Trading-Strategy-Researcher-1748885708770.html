        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for someone to "build a continuous pipeline of systematic trading strategies." That really resonates, as I've spent years wrestling with getting actionable ideas out of dense academic papers myself.

Once, I spent a week trying to implement a fascinating volatility strategy, only to discover a crucial calculation was missing from the original paper. Wasted time! From that, I learned the importance of rigorous vetting and clear documentation from the start.

For your project, I'd propose first focusing on reputable sources like academic journals and established trading books. Then, I can extract potential strategies, translating them into concrete, step-by-step rules. Finally, I can document each strategy clearly, flagging any potential caveats or missing pieces I find.

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and sources you have in mind.</div>
