        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" definitely caught my eye in your description of InsightMate. I spent a couple of years back in the day working on a platform that was drowning in those, and the inefficiency was brutal. We finally tackled it by prioritizing the user workflows that were costing the most time.

For InsightMate, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into the existing workflow and identify those friction points. From there, we could prototype some automated React components, focusing on seamless AI integration with your Python backend. Performance optimization would come later as we iterate on those prototypes.

Would love to chat more about your specific processes and how we could streamline them. Are you free for a quick call sometime next week?</div>
