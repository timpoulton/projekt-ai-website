        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I read your description and the bit about needing to design "scalable, secure, and maintainable backend systems" really resonated. I've seen firsthand how quickly technical debt can balloon with .NET projects if the architecture isn't solid from the start. I remember one project where we had to completely refactor the authentication system because the initial design hadn't accounted for federated identity – a painful lesson learned.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a thorough requirements gathering session to map out the specific architectural drivers, then move into creating a high-level design document outlining the key components and integration points. After that, we can dive into the specific .NET patterns and AWS services that best fit your needs.

Would be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your specific requirements and how my experience with .NET and DevOps can help.</div>
