About the Project

We’re MetaWorm — building a mobile-first gateway to the metaverse where users earn on-chain rewards through real-world behavior. Think: minting avatars, deploying location-based beacons, and earning tokens for daily activity.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey MetaWorm team,

Saw you're tackling those manual processes for on-chain rewards. I completely get that. Years ago, I was brought in to automate a crypto staking platform that was *completely* bottlenecked by daily reward distributions. A single, well-placed script cut their processing time by 90%.

For your project, I'd first focus on understanding your current beacon deployment workflow. Then, I’d map out the smart contract logic for your POA mining, making sure it scales with user activity. Finally, we’d build automated tests so you can be confident in the avatar minting process.

Sounds like a really cool project, and I'm intrigued by the mobile-first approach. I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss the specifics if you're free sometime this week.</div>
