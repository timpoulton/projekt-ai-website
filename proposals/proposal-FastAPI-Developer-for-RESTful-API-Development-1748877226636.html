        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my Upwork proposal:

Hey there,

Seeing that you're aiming to build efficient APIs to free up time from manual processes immediately caught my eye. I remember back when I first automated a client's inventory system, they were spending *hours* each week just manually updating spreadsheets. Once we integrated the API, it was like a weight lifted.

For your project, I'd start by diving into your specific data structures and workflow to design the API endpoints using FastAPI and Pydantic for robust validation. Then, I'd build out the core logic with SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Finally, I'd containerize it all with Docker for easy deployment.

If you're open to a quick chat about your current manual process and how an API could streamline things, I'm happy to share some initial ideas.</div>
