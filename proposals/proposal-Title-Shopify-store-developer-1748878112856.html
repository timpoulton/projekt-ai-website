        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to "design, develop, and optimize high-converting e-commerce websites" on Shopify. I get it – the optimization part can be a real time-sink. I recently helped a client who was manually updating product inventory; it was eating up hours of their week.

For you, I'd start by auditing your current theme and app setup to see what’s slowing things down. Then, we could tackle app integration to streamline some of those manual processes you mentioned. Finally, I'd focus on optimizing for mobile, as that's where a lot of e-commerce traffic is heading.

Would love to chat more about your specific workflow and how we can make it smoother. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
