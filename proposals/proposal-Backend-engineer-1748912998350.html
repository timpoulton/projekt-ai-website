        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading about needing a backend engineer who thrives in "dynamic, continuous improvement environments" really resonated with me. I spent a couple of years back in '16 rebuilding a legacy system for a logistics company, and learned firsthand how important it is to have someone who can not only code but also adapt and problem-solve on the fly.

For this project, I'd start by diving deep into your current backend architecture, focusing on potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization within the Java/Kotlin Spring framework. Then, I'd work on designing and implementing scalable solutions with MySQL, prioritizing robustness and maintainability. Finally, I'm big on collaboration and communication, so I'd work to integrate tightly with your existing team.

I'd love to chat more about your specific challenges and how I can help. Available for a quick call sometime next week if you are.</div>
