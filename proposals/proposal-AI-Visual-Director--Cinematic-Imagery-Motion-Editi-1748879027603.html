        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here’s that proposal, aimed at sounding authentically like me:

"Mythmaking through design," huh? I love that. I've spent years automating content creation, and the biggest hurdle is always translating the *feeling* a brand wants to evoke into something a machine can understand and replicate. It's more than just prompts.

I recently worked on a project where the client kept saying, "It needs more soul." We ended up using mood boards and reference videos alongside the AI prompts, a visual language bridge that really helped.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your brand's poetic core, creating that visual language guide. Then, we can translate that into detailed Midjourney prompts, ensuring real product integration. Finally, it's all about the cinematic polish in post – color balancing and resolution bump.

Does that resonate? I'd be happy to chat more about your vision and how we can make it happen.</div>
