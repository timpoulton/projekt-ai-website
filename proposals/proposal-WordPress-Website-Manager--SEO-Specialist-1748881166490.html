        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manual processes" and missing blog posts, ouch! I’ve been there. Actually, I recently helped a photographer who had *all* his image galleries vanish after a plugin update – turns out, a conflict had messed with the database. It was a bit of detective work, but we got it sorted.

For you, I'd start by diving into the backend to figure out why the blog posts disappeared, checking logs and plugin interactions. Then, with Beaver Builder and WooCommerce in the mix, I'd review the overall site structure and plugin configuration, focusing on mobile optimization and SEO best practices. Finally, I'd look into the Paid Memberships Pro setup to make sure everything is flowing smoothly.

If you'd like to chat about it, I'm happy to hop on a quick call.</div>
