        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Improving patient retention, lead nurture, reactivation, and email deliverability" – that really jumped out at me. I've seen firsthand how easily leads can slip through the cracks in a healthcare setting if the follow-up isn't dialed in, especially with missed appointments. Years ago, a chiropractic clinic I worked with was losing almost 40% of new patients after the initial consult simply because they weren't getting relevant post-appointment info.

For you, I'd suggest first auditing your current GHL setup to pinpoint where the biggest drop-offs are happening. Then, we can map out those automated email flows you mentioned – the "did not book" and "booked but did not show" are critical. Finally, we’ll work on refining the content to be more engaging and patient-centric.

Would be happy to chat for a few minutes about your current setup and see if my approach resonates.</div>
