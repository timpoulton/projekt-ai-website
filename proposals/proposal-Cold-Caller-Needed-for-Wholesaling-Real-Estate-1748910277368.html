        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking for a reliable and confident cold caller / appointment setter to support my real estate wholesaling business.

Your role will be simple and focused:
You’ll be calling leads from a list I provide and qualifying them by asking two questions:
	1.	Are you the owner of the property?
	2.	Are you looking to sell?

If they say yes to both, your job is to set the expectation that I (the business owner) will be contacting them directly. You do not need to handle any follow-ups, closing, or sal...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to handle cold calling for your real estate wholesaling, focusing on those initial qualification questions. I get it - manual processes can really eat up your time.

I remember once helping a smaller ecommerce business that spent so much time on customer onboarding, their actual product development stalled. We automated that in a week, and they tripled their output. For you, it sounds like streamlining that initial outreach is key.

Here’s how I see it: First, I'd carefully go through your lead list, prioritizing based on any criteria you have (location, property type, etc.). Then, I'd handle the calls using a clear, friendly script to qualify leads based on ownership and willingness to sell. Finally, I'd meticulously organize the qualified leads with clear notes for you to take over.

Would love to chat for a few minutes to see if my experience lines up with what you need.</div>
