        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Automation needs" definitely resonated with me – I get that feeling! I've seen how much time B2B sales teams can waste on repetitive tasks. Once, I helped a small manufacturing company automate their lead qualification process, and it freed up their sales team to actually *talk* to people, which boosted their close rate noticeably.

For you, I'd suggest starting by mapping out your current B2B sales workflow. Then, we can identify those bottlenecks, particularly around lead scraping and email outreach. Finally, build those n8n workflows to handle those repetitive tasks.

Let's chat about your specific needs and see if I can bring my n8n skills to the table. I'm happy to jump on a quick call.</div>
