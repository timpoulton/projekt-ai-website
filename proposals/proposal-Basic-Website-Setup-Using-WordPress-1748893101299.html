        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Establishing a simple yet effective online presence" â€“ I totally get that. I've seen so many businesses get bogged down in complexity when a clean, straightforward website is all they really need to start.

A while back, I helped a local bakery get online. They were worried about e-commerce and all the bells and whistles, but we ended up just focusing on a beautiful, easy-to-navigate site showcasing their menu and location. It made a huge difference for them.

For your project, I'd start with:
1. Building out the core pages and the contact form, using a theme that really reflects your brand's feel.
2. Making sure everything is mobile-responsive.
3. Optimizing the site for speed and ease of use.

If you are interested, let me know and we can set up a call to discuss further.</div>
