        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I saw you're looking for someone to help "collaborate on 3-4 AI-driven projects" and really understand the architecture, which is key. I've found that AI projects, especially with the ChatGPT API, can quickly become unwieldy if the foundation isn't solid from the start.

A few years back, I jumped into a project where the client hadn’t considered the data pipeline at all, and it ended up doubling the development time just to get decent results.

To avoid that, I'd propose first focusing on solidifying the architectural plan, then building out a prototype within one project to test everything, and finally expanding to the other projects with that shared, strong core. Daily sessions would be perfect for keeping the architecture clean and ensure the projects run smoothly.

Would love to chat more about your ideas and how I could help.</div>
