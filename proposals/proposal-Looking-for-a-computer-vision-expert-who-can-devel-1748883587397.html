        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" â€“ I hear you loud and clear. I've seen that exact scenario pop up a few times when trying to shoehorn advanced AI models into existing systems. One time, the output format clashed so badly with the client's reporting tool that the whole project nearly stalled.

For your shop comparison, I'd start by exploring pre-built tools like OpenAI to see how quickly we can get a prototype running to meet your two-form output requirements. Then, we'd focus on customizing the model's response format to play nicely with your dev team's integration process, potentially building a light API wrapper around it for easy access. Finally, we'd rigorously test this in your environment to ensure the integration is seamless.

If this approach resonates, drop me a message. I'd be happy to chat more about the specifics of your system and how we can make this a smooth process for your team.</div>
