        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! I read you're looking for someone who can handle N8N/Make.com, *especially* with AI integration â€“ that's definitely right up my alley.

I remember wrestling with a similar integration issue on a project last year, trying to tie a complex sentiment analysis model into a CRM workflow. It turned out the key was properly formatting the data payload before sending it to the AI. Such a small thing but stopped everything.

For you, I'd suggest starting with a quick audit of your existing flows and integrations. Second, let's identify the specific bottlenecks hindering your AI integration. Finally, build out a robust error handling system that'll notify you immediately if something goes wrong and needs attention.

I'd be happy to jump on a quick call and brainstorm some ideas for tackling those integration challenges. Let me know what you think!</div>
