        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for a Lead Generator/Appointment Setter, and what jumped out was the need for someone reliable to handle outreach â€“ the "manual processes" you mentioned. I get that. I've spent the last 20 years automating things, and honestly, sometimes the *best* automation starts with really solid, human-driven outreach. I remember one time a client was struggling with lead gen, we tried all kinds of fancy software, but the biggest impact came from simply making genuine connections and setting qualified appointments.

Here's what I'm thinking: First, I'd want to nail down your ideal client profile. Then, focus on crafting personalized outreach on social media (or whatever platforms you prefer). Finally, implement a simple system to track progress and ensure consistent follow-up.

If you're open to it, I'd be happy to chat more about how I can help you scale your lead generation efforts. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime next week.</div>
