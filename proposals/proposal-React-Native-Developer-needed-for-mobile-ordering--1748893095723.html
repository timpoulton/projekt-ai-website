        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are launching a new brand (mobile ordering platform--details will be disclosed on call) and are looking for an expert React Native to work on our iOS/Android mobile and tablet apps. Must be familiar with modern styling patterns and libraries including StyleSheet API, Nativewind, Unistyle, etc. and state management patterns/libraries like Context API, Redux Toolkit, etc.

React Native bridge proficiency is also a must, as our app utilizes native SDKs for Bluetooth receipt/label printers.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Mobile ordering platform...Bluetooth receipt/label printers" - that sounds like a fun, challenging project! I remember a few years back, I was helping a small coffee shop chain integrate mobile ordering with their existing POS system. Getting those thermal printers to play nice with React Native was a bit of a rabbit hole, but we got it sorted, and the client loved the improved order accuracy.

For your project, I'd initially focus on setting up a solid state management foundation with something like Redux Toolkit (since you're familiar), then tackle the React Native bridge integration for the printers. Finally, we'd ensure the styling is consistent across iOS and Android, maybe leveraging Unistyle for easier theming.

I'd be happy to chat more about your specific needs and how my experience with React Native and native SDKs could benefit your platform. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
