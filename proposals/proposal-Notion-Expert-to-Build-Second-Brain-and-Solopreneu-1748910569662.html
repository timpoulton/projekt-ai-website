        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I am a solopreneur focused on AI education and consulting. I'm looking to hire a Notion expert to build a "Second Brain" content system from scratch—a single place to capture, organize, and remix educational and marketing content.
This "Second Brain" system should be designed around minimalism, ease-of-use, and automation, specifically tailored to support a busy solopreneur’s workflow and creative productivity.

Below you will see the full scope of the work needed.</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! "Manual processes" definitely resonated with me – I remember spending a whole afternoon last year just copying and pasting webinar notes into different documents... total time suck!

Building a Second Brain in Notion is a smart move. I've helped a few solopreneurs streamline their content creation this way, and the key is simplicity. I'd suggest starting with a core database design based on your AI consulting workflow, then layering in Notion AI to handle content summarization and remixing. Finally, we can automate the connection between your capture methods and your content hub.

I'm really interested in learning more about your workflow, and seeing if I can help. Let's chat for 15 minutes?</div>
