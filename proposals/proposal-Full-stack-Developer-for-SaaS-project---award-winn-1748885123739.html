        <p>We're looking for a full-stack developer to finalise our SaaS application that is democratising data science in marketing. We have built algorithms that handle the entire analytical process. We have refactored them into APIs and are have been using loveable to integrating them into the front end.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Hitting roadblocks with loveable" - I feel your pain! I remember wrestling with a similar front-end framework integration on a previous SaaS project; sometimes the "loveable" tools end up being the biggest headache.

With my experience in full-stack and especially with Python backends talking to React front-ends, here’s how I’d approach this:

1.  First, I’d thoroughly review the current integration to pinpoint the exact bottlenecks.
2.  Then, I would refactor loveable or re-implement the APIs.
3.  Finally, thorough testing and bug fixing to ensure that everything works.

If you're open to a quick chat about the specifics, I'd be happy to share some ideas on how we could untangle this. No pressure, just a conversation!</div>
