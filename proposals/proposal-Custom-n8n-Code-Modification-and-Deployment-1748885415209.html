        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are looking for a skilled developer to download the complete n8n codebase, customize it with specific features according to our requirements, and deploy it on our server. 
The features we need to add:
 - adding an AI assistant using Antropic Claude to create workflows easily
 - making it SAAS
 - use Mysql for SAAS and for workflow as  a default and only one DB that our n8n will use. 

Please note that the budget is fixed but if your work is good enought you'll have another big bonus on that a...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to customize n8n with an AI assistant and turn it into a SaaS platform, using MySQL for everything. I get the appeal of streamlining workflow creation with AI.

I remember a project a few years back where I tried shoehorning Postgres into a system primarily built for MySQL â€“ what a headache! Learned my lesson about sticking with the right database from the start.

For your project, I'd suggest first digging into the n8n codebase and mapping out the existing structure. Then, I'd focus on integrating Anthropic Claude for the AI assistant and restructuring the database connections. Finally, adapting n8n for a SaaS model is going to be more of a longer process.

I think your project is complex to be done with 50$, i still bid on it because i see it as a way to start working together. Would love to chat about the n8n parts, just message me</div>
