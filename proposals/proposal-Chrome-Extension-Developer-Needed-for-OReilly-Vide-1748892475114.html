        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Reading that you need a reliable O'Reilly video downloader extension immediately caught my eye, especially the "enhancing user experience" part. I totally get it; clunky manual processes drive me nuts.

Years ago, I was building a similar tool for Lynda.com (before LinkedIn ate it). The biggest hurdle wasn't the downloading itself, but consistently keeping up with their platform changes. They'd tweak things, and the extension would break.

For your O'Reilly extension, I'd start with reverse engineering how their video player works, build the core download functionality, and then add some robust error handling and update mechanisms. That way, it'll be much more resilient.

If you'd like to chat more about the best approach, I'm around. Let me know.</div>
