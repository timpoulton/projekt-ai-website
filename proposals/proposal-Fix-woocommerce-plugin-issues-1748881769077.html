        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking for someone with expertise in developing custom WooCommerce plugins to help fix a small but important issue with an existing plugin.

The plugin is currently consuming too much memory and resources, and throws some errors during the sync process.
I believe it was poorly developed by the previous developer, as the API itself is fast.

The plugin consists of a sync that uses queues to import products from an API and also to send orders to that API.
It is also responsible for allowing i...</p>

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Consuming too much memory and resources" – I hear you. I've definitely been there. I once spent a week optimizing a product import that was choking a client's server; turned out the developer was pulling the entire product catalog into memory at once!

For your WooCommerce plugin, I'd suggest a two-pronged approach: first, let's profile the code to pinpoint the memory hogs during the sync process. Then, we can refactor the queuing system and the API interaction to be more efficient, maybe using pagination or smaller batches. That should address both the resource issue and the errors.

Happy to chat more about the specifics and see if I can help. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
