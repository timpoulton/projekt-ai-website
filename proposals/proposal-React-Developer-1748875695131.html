        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a React Developer to help with, "building internal products and solutions for clients," and developing new features. I especially noticed the bit about consistency across various clients.

I've been a solo automation specialist for 20 years and one thing thatâ€™s always struck me is how easily processes can diverge if there's no solid foundation. Remember helping a medical client with a similar issue. They were using a paper system. So, the same thing happening to a development process is very understandable.

With your project, I'd initially focus on reviewing your existing codebase, focusing on areas where manual processes are creeping in. Next, I'd help build or standardize reusable components within React to streamline development. Finally, I'd work on ensuring a unified UI/UX across all client solutions.

Would love to chat briefly about your project, get a better understanding of the challenges, and share some concrete ideas. Hit me up if you're available.</div>
