        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to tackle the AI integration with Bubble for your medical scheduling app. That "seamless user experience" bit definitely caught my eye. I spent a good chunk of last year wrestling with a similar integration for a telehealth platform – LLMs are powerful, but getting them to play nice with Bubble's data structure took some creative problem-solving.

For your project, I'd first dive deep into understanding the specific AI capabilities you're aiming for. Then, I’d wireframe a few calendar interaction flows and work with you to refine them. Finally, I would focus on making the data exchange between Bubble and the LLM as efficient as possible, focusing on robust error handling.

Would love to chat more about the intricacies of your vision and see if my experience aligns with your needs. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
