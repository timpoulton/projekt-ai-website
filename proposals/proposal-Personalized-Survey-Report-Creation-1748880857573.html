Hi there,

"Manual processes" jumped out at me in your description. I've been there! A few years back, a client was spending hours each week just copying and pasting data into individual client reports. We ended up using Google Apps Script to automate that, and it was a huge relief for them.

For your survey reports, I'd envision a similar approach: First, thoroughly understanding your current Google Sheets setup. Second, developing a script to pull data and populate your Google Docs templates automatically. And finally, rigorously testing the output to make sure each personalized report is accurate and reads well.

If you'd like to chat briefly about the specifics of your survey and reporting structure, I'd be happy to see if I can offer a more tailored solution. No pressure either way!</div>
