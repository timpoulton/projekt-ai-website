        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt:

Hey there,

"Automate PDF Extraction and Email Customization" – sounds like you're ready to ditch some tedious manual work. I totally get it. I once spent a week manually transferring data from invoices; never again!

For your project, I’d start by figuring out the best way to parse your PDFs (there are a few Make.com modules that can handle that, but the optimal one depends on the PDF structure). Then, we’d set up the Google Sheets integration and finally, design the email templates and map the extracted data to personalize them. I imagine we can get this automated pretty quickly.

I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your PDF formats and email needs in more detail. Let me know if that sounds good.</div>
