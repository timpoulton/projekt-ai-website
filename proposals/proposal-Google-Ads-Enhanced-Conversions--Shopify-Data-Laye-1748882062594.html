        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're wrestling with those "Missing user data" Enhanced Conversions errors – been there! I remember helping a client last year whose address fields were completely messed up. Turns out, a tiny Shopify setting was overriding the Google Tag Manager data layer. Drove us nuts for a week!

For your project, I'd start with a quick Tag Assistant validation to pinpoint the exact source of those errors. Then, I'd dive into your Shopify settings and data layer to ensure everything's aligned for accurate data capture. Finally, we'd double-check the GTM integration to confirm those address fields are properly mapped.

If you'd like to chat for 10 minutes about how I could help, let me know.</div>
