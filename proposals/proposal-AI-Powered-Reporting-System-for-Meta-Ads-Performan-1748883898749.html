        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

The idea of using AI-generated actors and voiceovers for Meta ads performance updates is really interesting. I know firsthand how much time goes into creating those reports, and making them engaging is a whole different challenge. I once spent a week fine-tuning a report, only to find out the client barely watched it. That's when I started seriously exploring automation.

For your project, I'd first suggest we nail down the key metrics that resonate most with your clients. Then, we can explore AI video generation platforms and test which actors/voiceovers best deliver those insights. Finally, we'll build the automation to pull the data, integrate it with the AI, and get those videos rolling.

If you're interested in chatting about the best approach for your situation, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to explore the specifics.</div>
