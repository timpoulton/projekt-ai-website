        <p>Overview

We’re migrating and expanding our cold email infrastructure across multiple domains and inboxes to support a team of 3 Business Development Reps. We need an expert who can handle domain setup, email account configuration, and integration with outreach tools.

This is a one-off setup project. If all goes well, we may have similar future work.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" – I hear you loud and clear! I just wrapped up a project where a similar setup was eating up the entire morning of a sales team. It's amazing how much time that kind of overhead steals.

Seeing your need to migrate those domains into Google Workspace and then link it all up to Apollo and Missive reminds me of that project. What I’d suggest is firstly tackling the Google Workspace migration, ensuring proper MX records and DNS propagation, then connecting Apollo and Missive while setting up those warmup inboxes to ensure deliverability. Finally, a quick training session with your team to make sure they're comfortable using everything.

Let me know if you'd be up for a quick chat to discuss the specifics and how I can streamline this for you.</div>
