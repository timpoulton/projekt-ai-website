        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for a CCaaS Solution Architect, specifically someone who can help with "workflow optimization." I hear you. A few years back, I helped a company wrangling with a similar problem on Genesys Cloud. Their agents were spending way too long clicking through menus to transfer calls. Turns out, a little scripting and a redesigned IVR cut handle times by a surprising amount.

For your project, I'd suggest we start with: 1) a deep dive into your current agent workflows and pain points; 2) explore platform-native solutions (like Genesys Cloud or Amazon Connect) to streamline those processes; and 3) create a pilot program to validate our changes before a full rollout.

Would love to chat more about your specific challenges and see if I can help.</div>
