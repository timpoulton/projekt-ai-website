        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to polish your website content, making sure it resonates with small business owners and avoids sounding "robotic" â€“ totally get that. Manual processes are a real pain point, so clear, engaging copy is crucial to draw people in.

Funny enough, I spent a whole afternoon last week rewriting a client's landing page where they'd accidentally used super technical jargon. Suddenly, conversion rates jumped!

For your site, I'd suggest first diving in for a thorough proofread, then focusing on refining the language to feel more conversational and relatable. Finally, I'd do a quick pass to ensure the tone aligns perfectly with your brand.

Would love to chat about your vision for the website and see if I can help. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
