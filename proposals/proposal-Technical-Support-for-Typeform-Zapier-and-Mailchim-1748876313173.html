        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading your description, I understand you need help ensuring "seamless connectivity and functionality" between Typeform, Zapier, and Mailchimp. I know that feeling; it's frustrating when these tools *should* talk, but don't.

I actually spent a solid afternoon last week troubleshooting a similar issue for a local non-profit. Turns out a seemingly minor setting in Zapier was the culprit, causing all kinds of headaches.

For your project, Iâ€™d suggest first thoroughly checking the API connections between all three platforms. Then, we can meticulously step through your Zapier workflows, response by response, to pinpoint any bottlenecks. Finally, we'll ensure the Mailchimp integration is segmenting and triggering emails correctly.

If you'd like to chat for 15 minutes to see if I'm a good fit, just let me know.</div>
