        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Martin,

"Looking for a talented, hard-working, and *experienced* Thumbnail Designerâ€¦" That's exactly the kind of partnership I enjoy. I've seen firsthand how impactful a well-designed thumbnail can be for YouTube - it can honestly make or break a video.

I've been freelancing for 20 years helping businesses automate their manual processes and think I can offer something unique to your channel. I'd love to start by diving deep into the visual aesthetic of HistoryInsideWW2 and Yarnhub, extracting key elements that resonate with their audiences. Then, I'd be eager to develop a set of thumbnail concepts tailored to your specific video content. From there we can tweak and perfect those based on audience responses.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific content strategy and how we can make your thumbnails stand out.</div>
