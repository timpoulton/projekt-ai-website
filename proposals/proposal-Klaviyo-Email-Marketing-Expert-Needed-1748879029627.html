        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I noticed you're looking to optimize your email automation flows - especially the welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase, and win-back. I get it, those are crucial touchpoints.

A while back, I worked with an online retailer whose abandoned cart flow was technically *working*, but it was justâ€¦ bland. We dove into their branding and infused some personality. Turns out, a little humor and personalized product recommendations worked wonders.

For you, I'd start by auditing your current flows for areas of improvement. Then, based on that data, we'll prioritize building out high-converting email content, incorporating segmentation strategies to boost personalization.

I'm always happy to chat about your specific needs and if you think I'm the right fit for this project. Feel free to shoot me a message.</div>
