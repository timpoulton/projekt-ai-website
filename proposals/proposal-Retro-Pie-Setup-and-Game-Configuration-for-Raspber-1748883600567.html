        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I have successfully installed RetroPie on my Raspberry Pi, but I’m having trouble adding games to it.
I’m looking for an experienced freelancer who can help me transfer and set up ROMs correctly, ensure the games are running smoothly, and provide general guidance on organizing and launching them within the RetroPie interface.
Familiarity with RetroPie, file formats, and emulation setup is a must. If you know how to make RetroPie shine and can walk me through the process (or do it remotely), I’d ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! I saw you're having some trouble getting those ROMs running smoothly on your RetroPie setup. Been there! I remember spending a whole weekend trying to get Castlevania to work on my own build years ago; turned out it was a simple BIOS file I was missing.

To get you squared away, I’d suggest we first troubleshoot any specific games giving you grief. Then, I can walk you through the proper folder structure and BIOS setup to prevent future headaches. Finally, if you like, I can even remote in and configure a front-end theme to make everything look super polished.

Let me know if you want to chat more about getting your RetroPie rocking. Always happy to help a fellow gamer!</div>
