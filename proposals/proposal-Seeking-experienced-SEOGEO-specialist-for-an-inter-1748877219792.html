Hey there,

Reading about your search for thoughts on how SEO is evolving with generative AI really hit home. I've been seeing the same thing – clients are slowly starting to ask about "AI visibility," but it's still early days.

A few months back, I had a client in the travel niche who was hyper-focused on ranking for local keywords. We ended up spending *hours* manually optimizing Google Business Profiles. Made me think: wouldn't it be great to automate some of that, to surface key trends more easily?

If we chat, I'd be curious to share some potential content workflow ideas:
1.   How to integrate a GEO tool into reporting.
2.   A brief analysis of a single GEO optimization.
3.   Then, discuss a list of requirements that this should do in the future.

I'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week!</div>
