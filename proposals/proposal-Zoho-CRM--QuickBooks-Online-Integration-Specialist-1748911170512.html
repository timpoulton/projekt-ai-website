        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my proposal:

"Connecting existing systems and building a robust solution like Zapier" – that really caught my attention. I get the ambition! I've seen firsthand how clunky manual data entry can cripple growth, especially with Zoho and QuickBooks. One client I worked with nearly lost a major deal because order info hadn't synced properly – the frustration was palpable.

I'd suggest first diving deep into your current workflows and pain points to create a very clear data flow diagram. Then, we'd map out the necessary Deluge scripts and Zoho Commerce connections for seamless integration. Finally, we'd implement a robust testing and monitoring system to ensure everything plays nicely together and scales properly.

I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to chat more about your specific needs and how my experience might be a good fit. Let me know if you're available sometime next week.</div>
