        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I read that you're looking for someone to help with "various administrative and legal tasks," especially replying to emails and following up on cases. I know that feeling! I once spent an entire week just chasing down missing documents on a similar project.

Over the last 20 years as an automation specialist, I've found that often, getting a handle on those recurring tasks can free up a *ton* of time. I'd suggest starting by taking a look at your current email workflow and identifying some common responses that could be automated with a simple rules-based system, then streamline the process of following up on cases with automated reminders and task management. For social media, we can use AI tools that can write posts and manage all platforms.

Would you be open to a quick chat about your current processes? No pressure, just want to see if I can offer some helpful suggestions.</div>
