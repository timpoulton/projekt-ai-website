        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to "audit your existing Klaviyo setup," which is always the crucial first step when dealing with a database that size. I actually helped a client last year who hadn't segmented properly in Klaviyo, and they were blasting everyone with the same offers – leading to a ton of unsubscribes. Ouch!

Here's what I'd suggest: first, a deep dive into your current segments and flows. Then, we can rebuild based on purchase behavior and customer lifecycle. Finally, let's A/B test some targeted reactivation campaigns to bring those dormant leads back to life.

Would love to chat for 15 minutes to understand your current challenges better.</div>
