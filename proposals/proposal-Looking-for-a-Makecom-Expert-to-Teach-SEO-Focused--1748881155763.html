        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m an experienced SEO professional looking to learn how to use Make.com (formerly Integromat) to streamline and automate key parts of my SEO workflows.

I’m not looking for someone to build automations for me, but rather to teach me how to create them myself — ideally through live sessions (screen sharing), focused on real use cases from my daily SEO routine.

Examples of what I want to learn:

Automating link building processes

Content brief generation and formatting

Data extraction from too...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's the proposal:

Hey there,

Saw you're looking to dive into Make.com to streamline your SEO, and particularly teach yourself to automate things like link building and content briefs. I get it! I remember when I first started using automation, I spent hours wrestling with a simple Zapier connection until I realised I was missing a crucial API key step. Talk about frustrating!

To help you avoid those kinds of early headaches, I'd suggest we start with a quick chat to map out your most time-consuming SEO tasks, then break down each workflow into manageable Make.com scenarios. We can then work through these in live sessions, focusing on the specific tools and data you're already using.

If this sounds like it could be helpful, let's schedule a short call to discuss further. No pressure either way.</div>
