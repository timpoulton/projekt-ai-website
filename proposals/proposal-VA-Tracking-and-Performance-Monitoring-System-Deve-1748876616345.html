        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manual processes, integration challenges, automation needs" – that really resonated with me. I've spent the last few years untangling similar bottlenecks for other small businesses. I remember one time, a landscaping company was tracking everything in a shared spreadsheet, and it was just a complete mess.

To help you out, I’d suggest starting with a clear definition of the VA's tasks and outputs. From there, we could explore a lightweight tool for time tracking and task assignment. Finally, we'd integrate that with a simple dashboard for ROI and performance viewing.

If you’d like to chat about your specific challenges in a little more detail, I’m happy to hop on a quick call.</div>
