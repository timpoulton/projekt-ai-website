        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" â€“ I hear you loud and clear! I spent a chunk of last year untangling a very similar situation for a logistics company. The biggest win wasn't the fancy scripts, but simply creating a central dashboard that gave everyone a single source of truth for equipment status.

For your camera network, I'd suggest we start with a quick audit of your current workflows, map out the pain points in detail. Then, using Python and TypeScript, we can build out those self-healing scripts and integrate them with your AWS infrastructure. Finally, let's design that inventory management system to flag low stock *before* it becomes a problem.

Interested in chatting about this further? I'm always up for a good problem-solving session.</div>
