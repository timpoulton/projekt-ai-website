        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's the proposal:

Hey there,

"Deep archive of training content and deliver precise, actionable answers..." That really caught my eye. I've wrestled with similar knowledge base integrations before. Actually, I spent a week last year pulling my hair out trying to connect a client's Moodle platform to their CRM – turns out the API documentation was outdated!

For your chatbot, I'm thinking we could start by: 1) mapping out the data structure across Vimeo, Brightcove, etc., to understand the "connectors" we'll need. 2) Then, build a workflow in n8n to ingest and structure all the video data, transcripts, and associated files. 3) Finally, create the chatbot interaction flow that pulls in the right info and documents based on user queries.

Would be happy to chat more about the specific platforms and how we can make this happen. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week.</div>
