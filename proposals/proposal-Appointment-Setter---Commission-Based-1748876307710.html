        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! I saw you're looking for an appointment setter, and the bit about "AI-powered automation" caught my eye. I've spent the last 20 years automating processes for businesses, often finding that the biggest bottleneck is simply getting people on the phone.

Funny enough, a while back, I helped a wellness clinic that felt exactly the same way - buried in manual outreach. We implemented a simple system using their existing CRM to automatically segment leads and personalize initial contact. This allowed us to dramatically reduce the human hours spent manually reaching out.

For you, I’d suggest starting with: 1) identifying key target business owners within your target industry, 2) personalizing initial outreach based on publicly available information, and 3) then creating a follow-up process to nurture leads until they're ready to book.

If this sounds like a sensible approach, I'm happy to jump on a quick call and discuss specifics.</div>
