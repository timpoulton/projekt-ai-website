        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw you're looking to untangle some workflows and get them down in Notion/Docs - feels like you're moving from that "we just *know* how things work" stage to something more scalable. I've been there myself!

I remember early on with a client in the finance sector, we thought we had a handle on their customer onboarding, but mapping it out with swimlanes revealed a half-dozen hidden steps that were costing them serious time.

For your project, I'd suggest we start by mapping one key process together to get a feel for the details, then I can translate that into a first draft of documentation in Notion. After that, we can review and refine it until it feels like a truly usable SOP.

If this sounds like a good approach, I'd love to chat more about the specific workflows you have in mind.</div>
