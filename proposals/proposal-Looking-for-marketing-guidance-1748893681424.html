        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey! Saw your post about marketing guidance and the Upwork invite. Just wanted to make sure you got it too!

You mentioned you're looking for some consultancy. I totally get it. Early on, when I was automating marketing workflows for a small e-commerce store, we spent ages manually posting on social media. Wasted so much time, then we automated it and saw such a massive boost in time saved.

For you, I was thinking we could start by identifying those repetitive marketing tasks eating up your time, then prioritizing the low-hanging fruit for automation. After that, we'll create a basic workflow.

If you're still up for a chat, let me know. No pressure either way.</div>
