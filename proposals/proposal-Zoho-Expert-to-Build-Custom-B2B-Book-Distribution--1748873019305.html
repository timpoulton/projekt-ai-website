        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I am a book distributor managing a warehouse operation. I purchase printed books from publishers and sell them wholesale to bookstores and retailers.
I‚Äôm looking to build a custom B2B portal using the Zoho platform (Inventory, Commerce, Creator) to streamline this process with the following goals:

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to streamline the book distribution process with Zoho, especially around managing publisher submissions and shipment notifications‚Äîtotally get it! Managing inventory manually can be a real headache, and I've seen firsthand how it can bottleneck growth.

Once helped a small artisan cheese distributor implement a system where suppliers could directly update inventory levels via a portal. Cut their back-and-forth emails by about 70%.

For your project, I'd suggest first mapping out the exact data points needed from publishers. Then, we can build the Supplier module in Zoho Creator with Inventory integration, focusing on intuitive forms and automated notifications. Finally, link it all up with Zoho Commerce for the retail side.

Would love to chat for 15 minutes to hear more about the specifics. Let me know when might work.</div>
