        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to manage the whole cold outreach process, from account setup to sending. That's a beast of a project! I remember helping a small SaaS company a while back. They skipped the proper warm-up and ended up with *all* their emails landing in spam. Lesson learned the hard way!

For you, I'd suggest a staged approach: First, meticulously setting up and warming the accounts (documenting everything, as you mentioned). Second, crafting hyper-targeted email sequences based on industry insights (I'm quite good at the research bit!). And third, carefully monitoring and adjusting the campaign based on deliverability and open rates.

I'd love to chat more about your specific needs and how I could make this a success. Maybe we can hop on a quick call?</div>
