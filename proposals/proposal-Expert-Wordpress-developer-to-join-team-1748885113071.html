        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to build WordPress sites from the ground up, not just plug in templates. I totally get that. Early on, I inherited a project where someone HAD just used a template, and the client ended up with a site that looked exactly like twenty others in their industry. Big headache to fix!

For your project, I'd first focus on really understanding your brand's unique visual identity and target audience. Then, based on that, craft a bespoke WordPress theme and WooCommerce setup. Finally, I'd optimize everything for SEO and integrate it seamlessly with your social media.

If that sounds like the kind of approach you're looking for, I'd love to chat more about your vision.</div>
