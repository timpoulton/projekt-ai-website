Tocco was born in 2022 to reimagine how we produce, not just how we consume. We‚Äôre building a B2B platform to make sustainable sourcing radically accessible ‚Äî combining the most extensive alt-materials database with the tools and editorial context that make it actually usable.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! "Automation needs" jumped out at me in your description. I completely get it. As systems grow, those manual processes quickly become a bottleneck.

I remember one time helping a small e-commerce business struggling with order fulfillment ‚Äì they were spending hours each day just copying and pasting data between platforms. We ended up automating their entire workflow with a few custom scripts, and it freed up their team to focus on marketing.

For Tocco, I'd suggest starting with a quick audit of your current processes to identify the biggest time-sinks. Then, we could prioritize automating those areas, focusing first on integrations between your database and user onboarding. Finally, we would set up monitoring so you can track the improvements.

If you're interested in exploring some initial ideas, I'd be happy to chat for a few minutes about your specific challenges.</div>
