        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to build a Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS shopping cart and control panel. Integrating with your existing REST API and tackling that aggressive timeline sounds like a fun challenge.

I remember working on a similar project a few years back where the backend API documentation was… sparse, let’s say. We ended up doing a lot of real-time collaboration to clarify endpoints. It was a bit hectic, but ultimately produced a tight integration.

For your project, I'd suggest initially focusing on mapping out the API interactions, then creating reusable Nuxt components styled with Tailwind, and finally, rigorous testing for responsiveness.

Interested in chatting more about your specific API setup and design preferences? Always happy to bounce ideas around.</div>
