        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I read your job description and here's what I'd send:

Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to streamline things between Shopify, Amazon, and Walmart – especially syncing up with your new Amazon storefront. I get it, manual processes are a killer.

I remember helping a small business owner who was literally spending half his week just updating inventory across platforms. We linked everything up, and he told me he felt like he'd gained a whole extra day.

For you, I'd start by diving into your existing Shopify setup, then mapping out a clear plan for the Amazon storefront design. After that, we can set up the integration itself, making sure everything flows smoothly.

If this sounds good, let’s schedule a quick chat so I can learn more about your products and specific integration needs.

Best,
Timothy</div>
