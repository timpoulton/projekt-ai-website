        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to really "build and scale email campaigns + flows." That’s exactly the kind of thing I love sinking my teeth into.

Just last year, I helped a small e-commerce store that was drowning in abandoned carts. We didn't just automate; we personalized the recovery sequence based on items left behind, seeing a noticeable jump in conversions.

For your situation, I'd suggest first auditing your current flows and performance, then building out those 3+ campaigns/week focused on segmentation, and finally, fine-tuning everything through A/B testing. Using Funnelish and Klaviyo, we can easily find the sweet spot.

Sound good? I'm happy to chat more about your goals and see if I can help.</div>
