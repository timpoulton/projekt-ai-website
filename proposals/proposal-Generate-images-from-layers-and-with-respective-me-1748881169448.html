        <p>I'll provide two folders with different layers, you'll need to generate 1k images and metadata from each one of them and then shuffle them between each other, so we gen 2000 images and metadata files in total. Then this metadata must be uploaded to gateaway to provide URI. 1-2 hours for completing the task</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Generate 1k images and metadata...then shuffle them"? Sounds like a task perfect for some behind-the-scenes automation – I totally get wanting to avoid doing that manually! I actually helped a photographer friend recently who was spending hours renaming and tagging product shots. We built a little script to pull metadata and organize everything, and it saved him a ton of time.

For your project, I'm thinking: 1) we'd build a script to automatically generate those initial images and metadata from your layers. 2) then, create a separate script to shuffle them and output the final set. 3) Finally, adapt the script to upload the metadata and provide the URI as you described.

If that sounds like a good approach, I'm happy to chat for a few minutes to see if it’s a good fit.</div>
