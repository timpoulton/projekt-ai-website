        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to build an AI avatar bot for TikTok live selling, to help with 24/7 engagement. That's interesting! I remember a similar project I tackled a few years ago for a friend who sold vintage clothes online. Initially, the bot was just answering basic questions, but after a few tweaks and integrating a sentiment analysis tool, it started offering personalized style recommendations – increased his sales by a surprising margin.

For your project, I'd suggest first focusing on integrating the bot seamlessly with TikTok’s live features. Then, we can train it on your product catalog and FAQs, using real user interactions. Finally, we’ll need to build in some smart response flows to engage users and push for sales.

I'm curious to learn more about the specifics of your product line and target audience. If you're open to a quick chat, I'd be happy to brainstorm some ideas.</div>
