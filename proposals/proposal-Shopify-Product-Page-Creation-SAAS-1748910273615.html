        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt at a believable Upwork proposal:

Hey there,

"Streamlining the product page creation process, saving users valuable time and effort" â€“ that really resonated with me. I remember years ago, working with a client importing from Alibaba, and the sheer tedium of copying details over and over almost made us scrap the entire project.

For your SaaS, I'm thinking we could start by mapping out the data structures from those platforms you mentioned. Then, create a Shopify app using their API that handles the automatic imports, with a customizable template system for consistency. Finally, implement a robust error-handling system.

Would love to chat about the specifics and how to make it as seamless as possible for your users. Let me know when you're free for a quick call.</div>
