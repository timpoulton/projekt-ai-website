        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're launching a new Next.js eCommerce site and need deep insights into traffic and purchase behavior. Makes sense, getting GA4 right from the start is crucial!

I remember helping a client migrate to GA4 last year, and the biggest headache was retroactively mapping their existing events to the new data model. We ended up spending way too much time cleaning up the data.

For your project, I'd suggest first diving into the existing Next.js setup, then creating a clear event tracking plan tailored to your specific customer journey, and finally implementing those events with best-practice GA4 code and debugging.

Would love to chat briefly about your store and how you envision tracking those key interactions. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
