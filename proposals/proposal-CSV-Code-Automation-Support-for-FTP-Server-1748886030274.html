        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Description:
We are seeking short-term support for an automation project that is nearly complete (approximately 90% finished). Specifically, the task involves automatically inserting code into a CSV file located on an FTP server.

If you have experience with CSV processing, FTP access, and automation scripts (e.g., Python, Shell, etc.), we look forward to hearing from you!

Here is the background:
The following is already working:
- Stripe creates a new customer
- Stripe creates a new invoice
- ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Manual processes" – I hear you loud and clear! I’ve definitely been there. I remember one project where a client was manually updating customer IDs across several systems after each sale. It was soul-crushing, and totally unnecessary.

For your CSV/FTP automation, I'd think we could tackle this pretty efficiently in a few steps. First, I’d quickly audit the existing scripts to see exactly where the gaps are. Next, based on that, I can write the code snippet to insert the correct customer information into the CSV on your FTP server when new Stripe data is created. Finally, thoroughly test to make sure everything fires as expected, before handover to you.

If you fancy a quick chat about the best way to tie those last bits together, let me know!</div>
