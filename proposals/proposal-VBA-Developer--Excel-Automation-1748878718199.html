        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to tackle some Excel automation and improve workflows. I totally get the need – I once spent a week manually cleaning a spreadsheet that could have been automated in a few hours with a simple VBA script! Drove me nuts, and taught me the value of a well-built macro.

For your project, I'd first want to really understand the specific tasks bogging you down. Then, I'd build and test the VBA solution in a development environment to make sure it's rock solid. Finally, I'd help you implement it and make sure your team is comfortable using it.

Happy to chat more about your needs and see if I can help. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
