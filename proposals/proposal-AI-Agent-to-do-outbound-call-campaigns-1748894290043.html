Hey there,

Saw your post about needing an AI agent to handle outbound calls and appointment booking. The "manual" part of outbound is definitely a killer, I get it.

I actually built a similar system for a small real estate agency a while back. The biggest challenge was training the AI to handle unexpected objections and still sound human. We ended up using a layered approach: first, setting up the core NLP and call integration, then focusing on scripting and iterative training with real call recordings, and finally, integrating it with their Calendly for seamless booking.

For your project, I'd suggest focusing on those three stages too, starting with understanding your existing systems and scripts. If this is a possible match, let's hop on a quick call to discuss your specific setup and script requirements.</div>
