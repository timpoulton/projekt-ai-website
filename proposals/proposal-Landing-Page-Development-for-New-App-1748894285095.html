        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Creating an engaging and responsive landing page...to convert visitors into users" – I get that. Early on in my freelancing, I built a landing page for a friend's pottery business that *looked* great, but didn’t actually get people to sign up for classes. Brutal lesson learned!

To make sure that doesn't happen here, I'd suggest first focusing on a clear, concise value proposition specific to your app. Then, we'd build a user flow that guides visitors intuitively to the call to action (download, sign-up, etc.). Finally, we'll ensure it’s completely responsive and looks amazing on all devices.

I'd love to chat about your app and explore some design ideas together. Are you free for a quick call sometime this week?</div>
