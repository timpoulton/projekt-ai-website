        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for an SEC-compliant website, and that "full SEC compliance" is key. I get it. I once helped a smaller investment firm that was initially fined because their website didn't properly disclose fees. It was a mess, and I learned a ton.

For your project, I'd start by really digging into the specifics of *your* fund's disclosure requirements, then map out the site architecture with those in mind. Finally, I'd handle the build, focusing on a clean design that doesn't sacrifice compliance.

I'd be happy to chat more about the legal necessities for real estate funds specifically. Let me know if you're interested in a quick call.</div>
