        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading your description, especially the need to reduce "manual effort" really resonated with me. I remember a previous client in the logistics industry, drowning in spreadsheets for dispatch routing - the frustration was palpable!

What I've found works best is first understanding *exactly* where the most time is being lost (a quick discovery call can pinpoint that). Then, we map out the current process to identify automation opportunities. Finally, we build and test the workflows, making sure they integrate seamlessly with your existing systems.

I'm confident we can identify some key areas to lighten the load. Would you be open to a quick chat next week to discuss your workflow challenges in more detail?</div>
