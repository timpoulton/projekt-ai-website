        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"User-specific access controls and enhancing overall system security" with USB devices on Linux really jumped out at me. I remember wrestling with similar issues years ago trying to build a kiosk system for a library â€“ ended up chasing my tail trying to handle permissions manually.

For your project, I'd start by digging into the current udev rules and identifying any bottlenecks. Then, I'd design a lightweight API to manage access, potentially wrapping udev or exploring alternatives depending on the specific security needs. Finally, thorough testing across a few common USB device types to ensure reliability.

I'd be happy to chat more about the details and see if my experience aligns well with what you're looking for. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
