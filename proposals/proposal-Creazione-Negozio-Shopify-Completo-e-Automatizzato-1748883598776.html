        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Zain,

"Minimal operational involvement from me and structured to generate sustainable sales" â€“ that really resonates. I've seen firsthand how businesses can get bogged down in day-to-day tasks and lose sight of the bigger picture. I remember helping a client who was spending hours manually processing orders; once we automated that, she was able to focus on marketing and saw a huge jump in revenue.

For LYVAYA, I'd suggest we start with a deep dive into your current workflows to identify those key areas for automation. Then, we'd design a Shopify store with those automations built-in from the ground up, focusing on elegant design and ease of management. Finally, we'd implement sales automations to keep that consistent flow, such as abandoned cart recovery and personalized product recommendations.

Would you be open to a quick chat sometime this week to discuss your specific automation needs and how I can help?</div>
