        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Saw you're looking for someone to build a comprehensive Shopify store from a purchased theme, and that includes handling all the product pages and legal stuff. That's often where things bog down, right?

I remember setting up a similar store for a client selling handmade jewelry a few years back. We got so caught up in the product photography, we almost forgot the legal pages, and *that* nearly held up the launch.

For your project, I'd start by getting the core theme integrated and looking sharp. Then, we can tackle the product pages in batches to ensure consistency. Finally, I'd dedicate time to crafting those essential legal docs and properly integrating the payment gateway.

I'd be happy to chat more about your specific needs and how my experience can help bring your vision to life. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week."</div>
