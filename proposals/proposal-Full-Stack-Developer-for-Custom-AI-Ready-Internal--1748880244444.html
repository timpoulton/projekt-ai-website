        <p>We are looking for an experienced full-stack developer to support the development of a modular, AI-ready internal platform for our company.

Who we are
We are an Italian brokerage agency in the energy and telecom sectors, operating with a lean, fully-remote structure and handling complex processes with minimal overhead. Our company is profitable and rapidly growing. We are now transitioning from an artisanal, manual phase to an industrial one — and we need the right infrastructure to support it....</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

The "artisanal, manual phase to an industrial one" really resonated with me. I've seen that transition firsthand with a previous client – a small logistics company drowning in spreadsheets. They were so close to scaling, but held back by repetitive tasks.

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into those manual processes you mentioned, mapping them out to identify the biggest time-sinks. Then, we could explore a modular approach for automating those bottlenecks, building AI-readiness right into the core. Finally, iterate based on user feedback for seamless adoption.

If you'd like to chat about this in more detail, I'm available for a quick call next week. Let me know what works for you!</div>
