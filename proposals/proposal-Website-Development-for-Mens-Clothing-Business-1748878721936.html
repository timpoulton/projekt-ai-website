        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Showcasing our products effectively and providing a seamless shopping experience" jumped out at me in your description. I've seen firsthand how clunky website navigation can kill conversions, especially with clothing. A few years back, I worked with a local menswear shop whose bounce rate was sky-high until we streamlined their product filtering.

For your project, I'd start by sketching out a user flow focusing on easy browsing and purchase. Then, we'd build a responsive design that looks sharp on any device. Finally, I'd integrate a secure payment gateway so customers can check out with confidence.

If this approach resonates, I'm happy to chat more about your vision.</div>
