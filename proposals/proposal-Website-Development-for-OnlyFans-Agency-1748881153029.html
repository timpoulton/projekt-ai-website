        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Hey there,

Reading about your need for a website that handles user registration and subscription management resonated with me. I recently helped a photographer streamline their online print sales, and the biggest headache was definitely figuring out a smooth subscription process for their premium content.

For your agency, I'd start by mapping out the user journey from registration to subscription, then build a responsive website with secure payment integration. Finally, I'd ensure everything is optimized for search so your content creators can easily be found.

If you're free for a quick chat sometime this week, I'd be happy to brainstorm some ideas specific to your needs. Let me know!"</div>
