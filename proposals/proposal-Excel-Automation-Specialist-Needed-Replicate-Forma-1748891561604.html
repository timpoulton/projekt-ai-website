        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We're looking for an experienced Excel automation specialist to help us streamline our reporting process. We have a template Excel file with specific formatting (e.g., cell styles, conditional formatting, column widths) and complex formulas (including relative and absolute references) embedded within tables on sheets with specific names.

Our goal is to replicate this exact formatting and all formulas from the template file to new Excel files. These new files will have the same sheet names and s...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to "replicate this exact formatting and all formulas" across multiple Excel files. I totally get that pain – manually copying and pasting that kind of stuff is soul-crushing!

I remember one project where a client was spending hours each week updating inventory reports the same way. We ended up using VBA to automate the whole process, and he practically got a day back each week!

For your situation, I’d start by analyzing your template file to fully understand the formatting and formula complexities. Then, I'd build a robust solution using VBA (or potentially Python if the files are huge) to programmatically transfer everything over. Finally, thorough testing to ensure accuracy before rollout.

Would love to chat more about the specifics and see if I can help you reclaim some time. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
