        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Gio. I design AI-powered automations and custom GPT tools for solopreneurs who want to grow their business without getting buried in busywork.

I’ve spent over a decade in marketing, operations, and business coaching. Now, I’m packaging up everything I’ve learned into done-for-you AI agents, Custom GPTs, and automations.

What I Need
I’m looking for someone who can set up these automations for clients once they buy. You won’t be building flows from scratch. I’ll handle the strategy, des...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey Gio,

"Growing without getting buried in busywork" – that really resonated with me. I’ve seen firsthand how quickly solopreneurs can get bogged down, even *with* great ideas. I remember helping a photographer friend who was spending hours manually moving images between cloud storage and her website; simple Zapier fix freed up a ton of her time.

For your clients, it sounds like the key is smooth, reliable implementation. My approach would be: First, thoroughly understand your existing automation blueprints. Second, meticulously build those out in Zapier. Third, rigorous testing to ensure those flows are flawless.

I'd be happy to chat more about your current process and see how I can best fit in. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
