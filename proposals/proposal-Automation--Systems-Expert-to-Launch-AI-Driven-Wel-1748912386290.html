        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there, Elate Wellness team,

"Seamless, client-ready infrastructure" – that's the sweet spot! I totally get the importance of nailing that *before* you launch, especially with something as personalized as AI-driven wellness plans.

A few years ago, I helped a hormone therapy clinic streamline their onboarding. They were spending *hours* manually inputting data. We automated that with a simple Typeform/Zapier integration, and it freed up their staff to focus on actual patient care.

For Elate, I'd suggest first mapping out your client journey to pinpoint key automation opportunities. Then, we'd build out those integrations—CRM, AI engine, payment processing— ensuring everything "talks" to each other smoothly. Finally, we’d rigorously test everything.

I’d be happy to chat about your specific workflow and see where I can add value. Let me know if you're free for a quick call next week.</div>
