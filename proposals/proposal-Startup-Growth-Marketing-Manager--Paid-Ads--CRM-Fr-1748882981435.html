        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey Zéya team,

"Strategise, launch..." I saw that cut-off sentence and immediately thought, "Ah, the joys of a startup needing to do *everything*." Been there! I remember helping a small e-commerce client a few years back who was manually pulling ad data into spreadsheets. It was a huge time suck, and we freed up a ton of their time just by automating that one report.

For your Meta ads and HubSpot combo, I'd start by digging into your existing data to understand current user behavior. Then, I'd want to set up automated reporting to give us a clear view of campaign performance and identify quick wins. Finally, we can look at using HubSpot workflows to nurture leads and re-engage users based on their specific actions in the app.

If this sounds like a good starting point, I’d be happy to chat and learn more about Zéya's specific needs.</div>
