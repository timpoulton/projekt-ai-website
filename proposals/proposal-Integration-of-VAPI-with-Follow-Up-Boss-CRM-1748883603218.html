        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to get VAPI talking smoothly with Follow Up Boss. Integrations like that can be tricky! I remember one time, similar situation, the client swore all their data was matching between systems, but a simple typo in the API key was causing everything to fall apart. Drove us nuts for hours!

For your project, I'd start by mapping out the data fields you need synced between VAPI and FUB, then build the API connection for real-time updates. Finally, we'd set up some automated tests to make sure everythingâ€™s flowing correctly and catches any future errors.

If you're open to a quick chat to discuss the specifics of your data, I'd be happy to share some ideas and answer any questions you have.</div>
