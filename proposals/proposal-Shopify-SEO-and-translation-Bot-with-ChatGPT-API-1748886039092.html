        <p>Objective
Develop an automated bot that:
- Receives a CSV file with the list of products in scope.
- Connects to the ChatGPT API using a custom GPT model (which will be updated continuously with relevant information).
- Sends product data in batches of n products to optimize API usage. The value of n will be configurable and tested for optimal performance.
- Uses a prompt that asks ChatGPT to generate translations and SEO data for each product.

Subject: Shopify SEO & Translation Bot - Let's Automate!

Hey there,

Saw your project about needing an automated bot to handle Shopify SEO and translations via ChatGPT. The bit about batching products to optimize API usage really caught my eye â€“ that's smart thinking!

I remember a project a couple of years back where the client *thought* they had optimized API calls, but the database queries were the bottleneck. We ended up shifting the processing to off-peak hours, which drastically improved performance and saved them money.

For your project, I'd start by building a modular script to handle the CSV import and ChatGPT interaction. Then, we can experiment with different batch sizes (your "n") to find the sweet spot. Finally, integrate it all into a clean, easily configurable tool.

If this sounds like a good direction, I'd love to chat more about your specific needs and how we can make this bot really shine.</div>
