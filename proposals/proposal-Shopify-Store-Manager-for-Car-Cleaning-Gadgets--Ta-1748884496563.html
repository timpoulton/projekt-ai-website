        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Looking for someone to take over full responsibility..." I get it. Wrangling a Shopify store while trying to, you know, *actually* run a business can be a serious headache. I once spent a whole weekend troubleshooting a wonky product import script for a client - turns out, a single misplaced comma brought the whole thing down!

For your car cleaning gadget store, I'd start by diving deep into your current setup to identify those manual processes causing the most friction. Then, we'd look at specific Shopify apps or lightweight code solutions to streamline things like product uploads and SEO. Finally, let's get those marketing integrations singing in harmony.

Fancy a quick chat to map out a game plan? No pressure either way.</div>
