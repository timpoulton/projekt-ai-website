        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt at an Upwork proposal, channeling my inner Timothy Poulton:

"Hey there,

Reading your description, the bit about wanting a site you can easily update yourselves really resonated. I get it – being stuck relying on a developer for every little tweak can be a real pain. I once spent three days trying to explain the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts to a client who just wanted his logo a *little* bigger. Never again, for either of us!

For your AI agent site, I'd suggest starting with a simple content management system (CMS) setup, focusing on intuitive design. Then, we'll ensure seamless integration of Relevance and vapi. Finally, I’ll create training videos showing you the ropes for easy content edits.

Interested in chatting through your specific needs a bit more? I'm happy to jump on a quick call whenever you have a moment."</div>
