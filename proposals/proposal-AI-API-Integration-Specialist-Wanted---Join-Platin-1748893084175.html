        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I saw you're running into "integration challenges" building AI solutions, and that really resonated. I’ve been there! A few years back, I spent a solid week wrestling with a Google AI Vision API integration on a smart inventory project, and it turned out to be a subtle authentication issue. It's always something!

For your drop service model, here’s what I’m thinking: First, I'd do a quick deep dive into the specific APIs you're working with – OpenAI, Google AI, etc. – focusing on potential integration friction points. Then, based on that, I'd create a streamlined process, documented step-by-step, to minimize future headaches and accelerate install. Finally, I'd share that documentation with Platinum Interface team so you can onboard future integrators faster.

Would you be open to a quick chat to see if my experience aligns with what you're building?</div>
