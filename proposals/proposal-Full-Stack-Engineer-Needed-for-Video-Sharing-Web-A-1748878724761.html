        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" and video streaming... that's always a fun puzzle! I remember helping a startup a few years back where their TURN server kept choking on even moderate traffic – turned out to be a subtle config issue with the firewall rules. Drove us nuts for a week!

For AvatarWalk, I'd start by diving deep into the logs to pinpoint the exact bottlenecks, then focus on optimizing your TURN server configuration. After that, we could look at refining the MERN stack elements to improve overall performance and address those bugs you mentioned.

If you’re free for a quick chat sometime this week, I'd love to learn more about the specifics of what you're running into. No pressure at all!</div>
