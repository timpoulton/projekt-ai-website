        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Bylines Studio,

Saw you're launching digital products to support both pros and DIYers â€“ that's a really cool niche! I remember helping a local landscaping architect set up a similar system a few years back, and the biggest hurdle was making sure the lead magnet download actually worked seamlessly. It was surprisingly tricky.

For you, I'd suggest starting with: 1) a quick platform comparison tailored to your specific product delivery needs (Flodesk, ConvertKit, etc.), 2) setting up the opt-in form and free resource delivery automation, and 3) creating a simple welcome sequence to nurture those new leads.

If youâ€™d like to chat about the specifics, feel free to schedule a quick call â€“ Iâ€™m available next week.</div>
