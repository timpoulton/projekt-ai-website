        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Academun.com's rebuild into a custom LMS... I get it. You're probably buried in manual processes right now, and that's exactly the kind of bottleneck I love tackling.

Years ago, I helped a small training company transition from a clunky WordPress setup to a streamlined, custom platform. The biggest win wasn't just the new features; it was finally freeing up their staff to focus on content, not admin.

For your project, I'd suggest first diving deep into understanding your current course structure and user flow. Then, building a robust, scalable backend, and finally, creating a Udemy-inspired frontend that's intuitive and engaging.

If you're interested in chatting more about how to streamline your workflow, I'm happy to jump on a quick call and brainstorm.</div>
