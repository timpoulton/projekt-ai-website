        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to really streamline your data-driven projects with automation, specifically tackling web scraping and AI implementation. That resonates â€“ I've spent the last 20 years neck-deep in this stuff.

I actually just wrapped up a project where the client was manually compiling market research data; it was taking them weeks. By building a custom scraping tool integrated with a basic NLP model, we cut that down to a few hours.

For you, I'd think we could start with a quick audit of your current data collection process, then build out a robust scraping pipeline, and finally look at integrating some AI tools to automate analysis and reporting.

If this approach sounds interesting, I'm happy to jump on a quick call to chat through the specifics. No pressure either way.</div>
