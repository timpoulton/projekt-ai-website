        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're struggling with manual processes in your AWS setup. That's a pain I know well! I recently worked with a startup where deployments were taking a whole day because of manual configurations. We shaved that down to 15 minutes with some clever scripting – felt like magic.

For your audit, I'd start by diving into your existing infrastructure setup to really understand the bottlenecks and potential risks. Then I'd focus on identifying opportunities for optimization, specifically addressing those manual processes you mentioned. Finally, I’d deliver clear, concise documentation outlining my findings and practical steps for improvement.

Would be happy to hop on a quick call to discuss your needs in more detail?</div>
