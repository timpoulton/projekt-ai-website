        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"I get the "manual processes" pain – been there! Years ago, I spent weeks trying to manually track link placements on Reddit, only to have half removed for looking too promotional. Frustrating!

For your project, I'd first focus on understanding the specific Quora and Reddit communities relevant to your niche. Then, I'd prioritize crafting truly helpful answers and comments, integrating links *very* naturally only when they add genuine value to the discussion. Finally, diligent monitoring and adjustment based on community feedback would be key.

Happy to chat more about your target audience and how we could make this a success. Let me know if you're interested in a quick call!"</div>
