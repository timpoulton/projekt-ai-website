        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a builder to tackle some full-stack features, and the "integration challenges" really jumped out at me. I get it! I spent a good chunk of last year wrangling data pipelines between a CRM and a marketing automation platform. It felt like untangling spaghetti some days, but figuring out the right APIs and data structures made all the difference.

For CharlieAI, I’d first focus on a solid understanding of your existing architecture. Then, I’d prioritize building modular, reusable components with Next.js. Finally, rigorous testing and monitoring from the get-go to catch any potential bottlenecks early.

If you’re free for a quick chat sometime this week, I’d love to hear more about your tech stack and discuss some potential solutions. Cheers!</div>
