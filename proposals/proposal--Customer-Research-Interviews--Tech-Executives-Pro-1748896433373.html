        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

The "manual processes" pain point for executives and program managers in project reporting definitely resonated with me. I remember one project I worked on involved a C-level exec basically spending an entire day each week collating reports from different teams ‚Äì a huge waste of their time, and a recipe for inaccuracies.

If I were helping with your research, I'd focus on a couple of things. First, understanding precisely *how* those manual processes manifest and the specific systems involved. Then, I'd dig into what kind of insights would actually make a difference for those executives in making faster, better decisions. Finally, exploring existing reporting tools they've tried (or avoided!) and *why* would be valuable.

Would be happy to chat more about your project if you think my experience could be a good fit.</div>
