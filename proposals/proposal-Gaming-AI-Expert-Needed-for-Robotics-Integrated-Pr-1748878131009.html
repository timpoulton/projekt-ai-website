        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

The "integration challenges" you mentioned really resonated with me. I recently helped a small startup trying to merge a sophisticated pathfinding AI with a physical drone, and the disconnect between the simulated world and the real one was a massive hurdle. We ended up having to build a custom calibration layer to account for real-world physics.

For your project, I'd suggest initially focusing on small-scale simulations with the robotics component, mapping out the discrepancies. Then, iteratively refining the AI agent's behavior based on real-world feedback. Finally, we could look at building a dynamic adjustment system to handle unforeseen circumstances.

I'm intrigued by the profit-sharing model, and would genuinely love to chat more about your vision and how my background might align. Are you free for a quick call sometime next week?</div>
