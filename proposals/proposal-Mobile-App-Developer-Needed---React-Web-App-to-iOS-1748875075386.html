        <p>We have a working React web application (built in Lovable.com) that helps parents find children's games based on various criteria. We need an experienced developer to convert this into native iOS and Android apps using Capacitor.

Project Overview

App Type: Children's game discovery/suggestion app
Current State: Fully functional React web app
Target: iOS and Android native apps
Technology: Capacitor (not React Native)

Key Features to Implement

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking to get your "working React web application" onto iOS and Android using Capacitor. I understand that integration challenges can pop up.

Funny enough, I recently helped a client move their PWA, a recipe app, to Android using Capacitor and the biggest hurdle was getting the push notifications working smoothly across both platforms. It took some fiddling with the Capacitor configuration.

For your children's game app, I’d suggest first focusing on setting up the Capacitor project and ensuring the core React app renders correctly on both iOS and Android simulators. Then, we can tackle any native API integrations (like push notifications if you plan on adding those) and fine-tune the UI for mobile.

If you'd like to chat about your specific concerns, I’m free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
