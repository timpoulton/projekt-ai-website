        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to integrate secure APIs into your Next.js build on Firebase.studio 2025, particularly for Stripe and user subscriptions â€“ and coordinating that with your mobile team. That synchronization piece can be tricky, I remember wrestling with similar data consistency issues a few years back when I was working on a cross-platform e-learning app. Spent a week chasing down phantom subscription cancellations!

Here's how I'd approach it:

1.  Dive deep into your current Next.js codebase and Firebase setup to map out existing data flows.
2.  Focus on building robust, secure API integrations for Stripe, ensuring seamless payment processing.
3. Work hand-in-hand with the mobile team to establish a reliable, centralized source of truth for subscription data, with clear communication protocols.

I'm happy to jump on a quick call to chat about the specifics and see if I can help. No pressure either way.</div>
