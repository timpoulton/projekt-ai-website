        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Hardworking" and "experience" really jumped out at me in your description. I've spent the last 20 years automating processes, and finding the right person who's both skilled and reliable is half the battle.

That 'Paint Explainer Style' video you linked? It's clever stuff. A few years back, I helped a local art teacher streamline her online lessons using a similar animation approach. It cut her prep time way down and kept the students super engaged.

For your channel, I'd first focus on creating a custom asset library of hand-drawn elements specific to your topics. Then, I'd set up a streamlined workflow for editing and animating based on your chosen style, and, finally, make sure the voiceover and graphics are synced perfectly for maximum impact.

I'm curious to hear more about the kind of topics you'll be covering. Feel free to drop me a message if you'd like to chat.

Cheers,
Timothy</div>
