        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Evolved Office team,

"Bringing Canva design closer to our platform" â€“ I get it. I've wrestled with similar integrations before, especially with platforms built on the .NET stack. Once, I spent a week chasing a ghost API call because of a subtle mismatch in authentication protocols. Fun times!

To get your Canva integration running smoothly, I'd suggest: first, diving deep into Canva's API documentation, specifically around sharing and SSO options. Then, I'd build a small proof-of-concept app to test the connection and authentication flow. Finally, we can integrate that into your existing MVC .NET architecture and jQuery framework.

Would you be open to a quick chat so I can understand the specifics of your setup and authentication needs?</div>
