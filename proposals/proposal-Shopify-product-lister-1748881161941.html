Hey there,

Saw you're building a dropshipping team and need a Shopify lister, and it sounds like you're focusing on clear communication. That's smart â€“ in my experience, dropshipping success *really* hinges on a smooth, reliable flow of product data.

I spent a lot of time automating the product listings for a client and it was a nightmare before, but once it was sorted it ran smoothly, and it gave me a real appreciation of the initial planning and process being spot on.

So, how could I help you? First, I'd want to really nail down your current product sourcing and data flow. From there, we can create a standardised process for uploading product information and automate product listing.
Finally, maintain product stock.

If this sounds like a good direction, let's chat for 10 minutes sometime soon? I'd love to hear more about your fashion dropshipping business.</div>
