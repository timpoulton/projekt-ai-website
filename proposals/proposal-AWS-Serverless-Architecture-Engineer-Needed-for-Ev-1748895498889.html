        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to optimize your event-driven architecture and get away from manual data aggregation. That resonates with me. I once spent a week untangling a system where someone was manually stitching together DynamoDB streams, and it was... not fun.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a deep dive into your current Lambda functions to identify bottlenecks, then work on refining your DynamoDB schema for optimal querying. Finally, we could look at API Gateway configurations to make sure you're minimizing latency.

If this sounds like a reasonable approach, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your architecture in more detail.</div>
