Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to tackle integration challenges with Make, N8n, and those voice agent platforms. That's right up my alley.

I remember wrestling with VAPI and Retell a few months back integrating them into a CRM for a lead-gen project - spent a full day debugging a webhook that just wouldn't fire right! It taught me the importance of meticulously testing each step of the process.

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into your current workflow on GHL, then map out the optimal AI-driven integrations. After that, building and rigorously testing the flows with Make and N8n, focusing on a seamless user experience with your voice agents.

Would be happy to chat more about the specifics when you have time. Let me know!</div>
