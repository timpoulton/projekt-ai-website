        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Find what kind of ideas would be good for me to shoot, and then help with making that a reality" – I get it. The research and brainstorming phase can be a real bottleneck. Years ago, I was helping a friend with his woodworking channel. He’d get stuck just *thinking* about videos instead of *making* them.

With your AI Automation niche, I'd start by deeply diving into the highest-performing content *already* out there. Next, brainstorm content pillars that resonate with your audience. Finally, weave in fresh perspectives from new tools you are testing.

Would love to chat more about how we can streamline the video creation process for you. Maybe a quick call to brainstorm some content ideas together?</div>
