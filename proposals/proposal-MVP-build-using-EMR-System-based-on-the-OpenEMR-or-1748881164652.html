        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading about the need for an EMR MVP with Tissue Analytics and HIPAA compliance, especially addressing those manual processes, really resonated with me. I remember helping a smaller clinic move from paper records to a basic OpenEMR setup years ago, and seeing how much time and stress it saved them was incredibly rewarding.

For your project, I'd suggest initially focusing on a core feature set within OpenEMR or OpenMRS to get a functional MVP up and running quickly. Then, we can integrate the Tissue Analytics mobile app, ensuring data security every step of the way. Finally, we can address the HIPAA compliance specifically for your workflow.

If youâ€™d like to chat about your specific needs and how we can tackle this together, I'm happy to jump on a call.</div>
