Project Overview:

We're relatively new to Webflow and have been trying to integrate our content from Airtable. We thought Whalesync would be the perfect solution, but it turned out that our data structure, with many junction tables, was too complex. The result? Data that wouldn't sync properly and UI components that displayed incorrectly. We need a bet...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey FCF team,

"Data that wouldn't sync properly and UI components that displayed incorrectly" â€“ I felt that! Been there, wrestled with that. I once spent a week trying to wrangle data with Zapier, only to realize a custom API connection was the only way to truly tame it.

Seeing as Whalesync wasnâ€™t a perfect fit for your complex data, I'd suggest we first dive deep into your Xano setup and Webflow structure. Then, we could explore building custom Xano API endpoints specifically for your Webflow components. Finally, thorough testing to ensure a seamless experience.

Would be happy to chat through the specifics and see if my experience could be helpful here.</div>
