        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt:

Hi there,

"Stealth copy trading software for MT5…low latency." That immediately caught my eye. I remember years ago, trying to optimize a similar system and getting bogged down in the API limitations. It took days of digging through forum posts and eventually finding a workaround using custom DLLs to really get the speed I needed.

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into the MT5 environment to map out potential bottlenecks. Then, I'd focus on crafting the core logic for the copy trading, prioritizing minimal resource consumption. Finally, rigorous testing on a simulated trading environment would be key to ensure stability and those crucial low-latency execution speeds.

If you'd like to chat about the specifics of your current setup and challenges, I’m happy to schedule a quick call. No pressure at all!</div>
