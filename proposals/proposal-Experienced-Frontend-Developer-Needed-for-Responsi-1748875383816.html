        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a frontend dev to help build a responsive web app, and specifically calling out the need to integrate with your backend. That's always a fun challenge! I remember one project where the API documentation was…let's just say "minimalist," and it took a good bit of back-and-forth with the backend team to get things flowing smoothly.

For your project, I’d suggest first setting up a solid component library based on the designs to ensure consistency. Then, as we hook up the APIs, we can use a mock API server to iron out any integration kinks before hitting the live backend, saving some time. Finally, thorough testing on different devices and browsers is crucial to ensure responsiveness.

Would love to chat more about your specific requirements and how I can contribute. Are you free for a quick call sometime next week?</div>
