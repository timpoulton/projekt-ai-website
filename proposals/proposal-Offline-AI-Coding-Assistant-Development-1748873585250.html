        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to build an offline AI coding assistant â€“ "tackle a challenging project" indeed! I've been tinkering with local AI models for a while now. Actually, just last month I was trying to get a similar setup running on a Raspberry Pi for a personal project, and learned a few things the hard way about optimizing performance on limited resources.

Here's how I'd approach it for you: First, a deep dive into selecting the right Ollama model for your specific coding needs. Then, designing a lean system architecture that prioritizes speed and offline functionality. Finally, rigorous testing to ensure it's actually helpful and not just spitting out random code snippets.

Would love to chat more about your vision for the assistant and see if my experience aligns with what you're hoping to achieve. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
