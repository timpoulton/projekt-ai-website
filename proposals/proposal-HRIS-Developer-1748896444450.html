        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Automation needs" â€“ that really resonated with me. I've seen firsthand how clunky HR processes can become, especially when manually tracking things like leave and salary.

A few years back, I helped a small company finally integrate their payroll system with their time-off tracking. The relief on the HR manager's face when she realized she didn't have to spend two days a month reconciling everything was priceless.

For your project, I'd start by diving deep into your specific requirements with HR and the Dev team, then focus on customizing OrangeHRM to fit those needs, with initial priority on salary tracking, unpaid/paid leave announcements, and then moving to other features. Finally I will work with the Dev team to ensure that the system runs smoothly.

Would love to chat about your exact vision and how to make this a smooth, automated process for you.</div>
