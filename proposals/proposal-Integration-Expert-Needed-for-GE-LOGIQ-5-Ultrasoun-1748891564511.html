        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"Automatic transfer of DICOM and HL7 data… to our web application" – that's exactly the kind of challenge that gets me excited. I've spent a lot of time untangling medical data streams. I recall one project integrating a brand new MRI machine; the HL7 messages were almost deliberately obtuse, but we got there by systematically mapping each field and message type.

For your GE LOGIQ 5, I’d start by thoroughly analyzing its DICOM and HL7 output via a network capture to understand its current data format. Then, I'd set up a reliable TCP/IP connection to your web application, ensuring secure data transmission and implementing any necessary transformations. Finally, we would rigorously test the integration with real ultrasound data.

I'm eager to learn more about your web application and the specific data you need. Would you be open to a quick chat to discuss this further?</div>
