        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to "enhance your massage school's outreach" and get away from manual processes. I totally get that. I once spent a week manually emailing leads for a pottery school, and by the end, I could practically throw a perfect vase myself from the sheer repetition!

To help you attract those new students, I'd suggest first focusing on a compelling email drip campaign based on your different programs, then tying that into GHL automations to qualify leads, and finally crafting some engaging social posts that really highlight the school's unique vibe.

If you're curious how those steps might look in more detail, I'm happy to chat. No pressure either way, just thought I could offer a hand.</div>
