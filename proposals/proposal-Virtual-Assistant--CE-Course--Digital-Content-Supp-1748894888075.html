        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I saw you're looking for someone to lighten the load with managing digital content and email campaigns – you mentioned manual processes as a pain point, and I totally get that!

Years ago, I helped a friend who ran a small online shop. She was spending hours each week manually uploading product images and sending email blasts. We automated the whole process with a simple Zapier integration, and she literally cried when she realized how much time she'd get back.

For you, I'd focus on: 1) streamlining the ThriveCart uploads with a repeatable process, 2) setting up automated sequences in Encharge (or your preferred platform) to handle course enrollments, and 3) creating a simple content calendar for your social media posts.

Would love to chat more about your specific needs and see if I can help free up some of your time.</div>
