        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading about your need for someone to help manage email campaigns and paid ads for your hair and beauty brand immediately caught my eye. Especially your need for experience with Klaviyo, Google Ads, and Google Analytics.

I remember once working with a client in the similar space, where their abandoned cart sequence was performing terribly. We dug into the Google Analytics data and found that mobile users were having a really hard time with the checkout form. Simple fix, huge impact.

For you, I'd start by taking a deep dive into your current data across those platforms to identify quick wins and areas for optimization. Then, we could prioritize automating some of the more repetitive tasks in Klaviyo. Finally, ensuring everything aligns with your overall marketing strategy.

If this sounds like a good fit, I'd be happy to chat more about your specific needs and how I can help.</div>
