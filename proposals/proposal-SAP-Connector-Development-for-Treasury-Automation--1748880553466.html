        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking to build an SAP connector for your treasury automation software to streamline operations, which, believe me, I totally get the need for. I remember helping a smaller company years back who were manually reconciling bank statements. After a week of banging my head against the wall, we finally got a similar connector working and the sigh of relief from their treasury team was audible down the hallway!

For your project, Iâ€™d suggest initially focusing on understanding the specific data flow needed between SAP and your software. Then, we could create a well-defined API to handle that data exchange, focusing on efficiency and security. Finally, thorough testing to ensure accurate data transfer would be critical.

If you're open to chatting about the specifics of your current setup and what you envision for this connector, I'd be happy to share some ideas. No pressure either way!</div>
