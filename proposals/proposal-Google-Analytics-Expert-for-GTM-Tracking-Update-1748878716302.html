        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Key Pain Points Detected: manual processes" - I definitely understand that feeling! I was helping a client streamline their e-commerce tracking last year, and we discovered they were *manually* uploading conversion data. It was a real bottleneck.

For your GTM/GA4 update, I'd suggest starting with a quick audit of your existing GTM setup to identify any redundancies or conflicts. Then, we can focus on migrating your crucial events and conversions to GA4, ensuring accurate data capture. Finally, we'll set up real-time monitoring to confirm everything's firing correctly.

Would be happy to chat for 10-15 minutes to hear more about your current setup and goals. Let me know if you have some time.</div>
