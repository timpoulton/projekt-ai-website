        <p>Hi,

I'm looking to automate the following so that I can focus on designing my products and save time on the administrative side of things. I'm not sure what this should cost so please feel free to provide me with a quote.

This is what I have in mind but am happy to hear suggestions if you think there's a better approach.

I export a png and save it to a Google Drive
This triggers the following steps.

1. A product is created in Printify
- resizing the image if it is for a t-shirt, for example

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

I understand you're looking to automate the Printify/Shopify sync so you can spend more time designing â€“ makes total sense. I've seen this bottleneck before; it's incredibly frustrating when creative energy gets sucked into admin.

I once spent two days manually uploading designs for a client's new line of mugs. After that, I was *determined* to find a better way and built them a similar system to what you're describing.

Here's how I'd approach your project: first, we'd establish a reliable trigger from your Google Drive uploads. Then, we'd map the PNG dimensions to the correct Printify product type and resizing rules. Finally, we'd tie that into Shopify, so new products appear automatically.

Happy to chat more about the details. Feel free to book a call so we can discuss your project.</div>
