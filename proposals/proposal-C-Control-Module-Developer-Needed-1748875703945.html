        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to build control modules, and the bit about needing seamless integration definitely jumped out at me. I remember years ago, spent a week tracking down a memory leak in a system where the modules weren't playing nice - nightmare.

For your project, I'd start by taking a deep dive into your existing architecture to really understand how the new modules need to fit in. Then, based on that, I'd propose a modular C++ design focusing on clean interfaces for easy updates down the road. Finally, rigorous testing, of course, to catch any integration gremlins before they cause bigger problems.

Would be happy to chat more about your specific needs and see if my experience could be a good fit. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
