        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to streamline that Lead to Quote process – I get the frustration of manual processes slowing things down. I actually spent a good chunk of last year untangling a very similar situation for a window manufacturer. The biggest win came from automating the initial product interest categorization; saved them a ton of back-and-forth.

For your setup, I'm thinking we could first map out your existing Lead fields and identify the key triggers for quote generation. Then, design a Flow that automatically pulls that data into a new Quote record. Finally, we'd tie that Flow to specific Opportunity stages for tracking.

Interested in chatting more about how that might look in your specific Salesforce setup?</div>
