        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Hello!

Iâ€™m currently in the pre-production phase of a project that will require extensive camera tracking and cleanup work, and Iâ€™m looking for skilled freelancers to collaborate with.

We have a previsualization 3D animation that outlines the intended camera movement, which you can view here:

Weâ€™re currently exploring the best approach for integrating and removing human elements from the shot. Specifically...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! Saw your project involving integrating and removing human elements with 3D camera tracking - pretty cool previsualization video!

"Key pain points detected: manual processes" - I hear you loud and clear on that. I recently wrapped up a project where the entire cleanup process was initially planned manually. We quickly realized it was a recipe for late nights and headaches!

For your project, I'd suggest first creating a robust 3D camera track from your footage aligned to the previsualization animation. Next, we'd explore automated masking/roto techniques to isolate the human elements, and finally, integrate those into the 3D environment. This would significantly reduce manual labor.

I'm curious to hear more about the specific challenges you're anticipating. Let's hop on a quick call sometime this week to chat about potential solutions?</div>
