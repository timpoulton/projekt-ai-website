        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking to "automate the process of enriching contact records from Attio and syncing them to Brevo." That hits home! I remember wrestling with a similar Attio/Mailchimp integration for a startup last year. The challenge was dealing with Attio's nested data structures – figuring out the right Make modules and data mapping took a bit of trial and error.

For your project, I'd start by: 1) mapping out the exact Attio Person and Company fields you need in Brevo, 2) build a Make scenario that pulls that data, transforms it as needed, and then 3) uses Brevo's API to create or update contacts, paying special attention to avoiding duplicates.

Would be happy to chat through the specifics and see if my experience aligns with what you're after. Let me know if you're free for a quick call sometime this week.</div>
