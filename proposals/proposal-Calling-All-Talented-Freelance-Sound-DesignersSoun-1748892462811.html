        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for reliable sound designers for those explainer videos – building a "bench" of talent is smart. I totally get the need for that consistent quality, especially when you're aiming for that 'wow' factor.

Years back, I had a client who went with a budget option on sound design, and the whole animation felt flat. We ended up redoing it, costing way more in the end. Lesson learned!

For these videos, I’d suggest first focusing on a shared style guide to ensure consistency, then a streamlined feedback loop on drafts, and finally setting up a clear payment schedule to keep everyone happy and motivated.

If you're open to a quick chat about how you envision the workflow, I'd be happy to share some ideas. No pressure at all.</div>
