        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We’re rebuilding our football predictions platform and are looking for an experienced ML developer or team to help us develop a complete machine learning system that can predict multiple betting markets across global football leagues.

This is not just a small script, we’re building something long-term and serious. The frontend is already under development in WordPress, and we are now focusing on creating a reliable backend model that can accurately generate predictions from data.

We are only i...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, here's my attempt at a believable Upwork proposal:

Hey there,

"Building something long-term and serious" – that really resonated with me. I've seen so many prediction projects start strong then fizzle because the backend wasn't properly built.

Early on, I worked on a sports analytics project where we rushed the data pipeline. The model was great, but the data was garbage in, garbage out. It completely undermined our predictions. Learned my lesson!

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a solid data foundation – cleansing and structuring the football data. Then, we could iteratively build and test your XGBoost model, focusing on specific betting markets at a time. Finally, we could integrate this into your WordPress front-end, for a seamless user experience.

Would love to chat more about your data sources and initial model ideas. Let me know if you're free for a quick call. Cheers!</div>
