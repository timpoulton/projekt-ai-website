        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking for someone to translate handwritten Assyrian medical notes. That manual process can be a real bottleneck â€“ I get it. I once helped a small clinic digitize and translate their patient intake forms and just figuring out the best character recognition software for the old script was half the battle.

For these notes, I'd start by carefully reviewing some samples to assess the script's legibility. Then, using a combination of translation memory tools and human expertise (my own!), I'd deliver accurate translations in a clear, organized format. Finally, we could explore creating a searchable database of terms for future efficiency.

Would be happy to chat more about the specific challenges of these notes and how I can help streamline things.

Best,
Tim</div>
