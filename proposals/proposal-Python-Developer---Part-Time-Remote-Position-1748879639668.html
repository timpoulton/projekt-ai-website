        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey Teammate AI Team,

Read your description about needing help building and maintaining your AI automation platforms â€“ resonates with me! I spent a good chunk of last year untangling a knot of integration issues for a marketing startup that was drowning in disconnected AI tools. It was a mess, but taught me the importance of rock-solid backend architecture.

For your situation, I'd suggest first focusing on a clear API strategy to ensure smooth data flow. Then, we could build out robust unit tests for each automated function to catch errors early. Finally, I'd suggest creating detailed documentation to help maintain your code long-term.

Would love to chat about the specific tech stack you're using and how I can help make your AI platforms even more impactful. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
