        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We're looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our existing mobile application, Funky Live. We need a developer who can modify existing features, enhance the UI/UX, and integrate new interactive components such as mini-games and animated gift-sharing features (similar to SVGA animations in Fancy Live).

Responsibilities:

Modify and enhance existing features of the Funky Live app

Integrate mini-games into the app to boost user engagement

Implement fancy gift-sharing animations (SVGA...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Integrating mini-games and SVGA animations, especially into an existing app, can definitely be tricky," I read that and immediately thought about a project I did last year where we had to shoehorn some Unity-based AR features into an otherwise native iOS app. The integration itself was surprisingly smooth, but the *communication* between the new and old codebases? A nightmare!

Here's how I'd tackle this for Funky Live: first, I'd do a deep dive into your current code structure to understand the best way to "plug in" these new features without causing performance issues. Then, we can prototype one mini-game and the animation integration to make sure they feel seamless within the Funky Live experience. Finally, weâ€™d iterate based on your feedback.

Would love to chat more about the specifics of your codebase and the kind of mini-games you're envisioning. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
