        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to "keep day-to-day operations running smoothly" - that really resonates. I've spent the last 20 years untangling exactly that kind of knot for businesses.

A few years back, I helped a small marketing team who were drowning in spreadsheets. The biggest win wasn't some fancy software, but simply building a shared task board that everyone actually *used*. Suddenly, deadlines weren't a mystery anymore.

For you, I'd suggest initially focusing on: 1) Mapping out your current workflow to identify the biggest time-sucks. 2) Then, implementing a central communication/task management system. 3) Finally, creating basic documentation to streamline repeatable processes.

I'd be happy to jump on a quick call to explore your needs in more detail and see if my background is a good match. Let me know if you're interested.</div>
