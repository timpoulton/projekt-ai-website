        <p>**If messy Looms don’t scare you, and your superpower is bringing clarity to confusion, keep reading.**

We’re seeking a junior or mid-level Operations Assistant who is highly organized, detail-oriented, and able to transform raw content (such as Loom videos, call recordings, or course materials) into clear, structured Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and workflows.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Messy Looms don’t scare you..." That line resonated! I spent a good chunk of last month untangling a client's onboarding process, which was essentially a collection of 30+ haphazard videos. The relief on their face when they finally had a clear, documented process was priceless.

For your project, I'd suggest a phased approach: first, a deep dive into the existing materials (Looms, etc.) to understand the current, albeit messy, process. Then, we'd map out those steps into a structured workflow using a tool like Notion or Google Docs (whichever you prefer). Finally, we'd refine the documentation into clear, concise SOPs.

If this sounds like the kind of help you're looking for, let's hop on a quick call to chat about it further.</div>
