        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Google is still not indexing the new pages properly" - I hear you loud and clear. Been there! I remember wrestling with a similar issue for a client after they migrated to a new CMS. Turns out, the old sitemap was still lingering and causing confusion.

Based on your description, I'd suggest:
1. A thorough audit of your sitemaps (both active and inactive) in Search Console, ensuring the old ones are removed.
2. Deep crawl of the website checking for stray internal links to old URL paths, also submitting the new site map.
3. Requesting a removal of the outdated URLs directly through Search Console.

It can be a bit of a detective game, but usually pretty straightforward. If you're up for a quick chat about how I approach this, let me know.</div>
