        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi Harsh,

"Remote work opportunity for a Python Developer role" – that caught my eye, especially the full-stack Python development aspect. I've spent the last 20 years as an automation specialist, and there’s real power in having a solid Python foundation.

Actually, early in my career, I struggled with maintaining a spaghetti-code CRM. It made me realize how crucial well-structured Python code is for maintainability and scalability.

Based on your request, my approach would be to: 1) get a better sense of the specific US company's environment, and what needs attention 2) evaluate their tech stack and data flow so that I can ensure code quality as well as maintainability, and 3) based on steps 1 & 2, offer a plan for scaling as well as automating processes.

I’d love to learn more about the opportunity and see where my skills could be a good fit. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
