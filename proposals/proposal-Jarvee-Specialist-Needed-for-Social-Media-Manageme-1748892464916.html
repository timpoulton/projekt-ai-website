        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Seeing you're looking for someone to handle the manual grind with Jarvee really resonated with me. I remember back in 2018, I spent weeks manually liking and commenting on photos in my niche. What a waste of time! That's what got me seriously diving into advanced Jarvee setups.

For you, I'd suggest first auditing your current accounts and setting up a rock-solid proxy network. Then, we can design safe automation strategies for comments and DMs, starting slow and scaling up gradually. Finally, we’ll need to put solid analytics in place to measure what’s working and what needs tweaking.

If this sounds like a good starting point, I'd be happy to chat more about your specific goals.</div>
