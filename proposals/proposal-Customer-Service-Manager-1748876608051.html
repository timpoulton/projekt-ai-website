        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reaching eight figures with your Dutch dropshipping business is an exciting goal. I noticed your mention of needing help with representing the company through better customer service, and from my experience, it usually stems from inefficient processes that can eat into your time.

I spent a year early on manually processing returns for a clothing retailer and quickly realized the bottleneck it created. We were constantly playing catch-up, and customer experience suffered.

For your situation, I'd suggest we start by identifying the most time-consuming customer service tasks, then look at automation possibilities, like integrating a robust ticketing system to streamline responses and personalize follow-ups.

If this sounds like a reasonable path forward, I'm happy to hop on a quick call to discuss specifics.</div>
