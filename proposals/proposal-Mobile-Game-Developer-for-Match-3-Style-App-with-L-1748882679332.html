Hey there,

"Light erotic storytelling" in a match-3 game â€“ that's an interesting combination! I've seen a lot of match-3s become almost addictive, and I think weaving in a compelling character and narrative could really set yours apart.

A few years back, I helped a friend create a visual novel and the trickiest part was balancing story with gameplay. So, for your project, I'd suggest we start with a solid game loop prototype *first*, then integrate short, impactful cutscenes to maintain momentum. Finally, getting AdMob integrated early will make sure things are on track.

Curious to hear more about the character you have in mind. Maybe we can hop on a quick call to brainstorm?
