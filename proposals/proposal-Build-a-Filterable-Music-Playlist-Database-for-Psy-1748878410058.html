        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m creating a private music playlist database as a product for paying customers. My platform is focused on psychedelics, creativity, healing, and personal growth). I need your help building a clean, filterable, easy-to-update system that works smoothly. I use Thrivecart and have with ThriveCart Learn (which I already use for courses) so that might be a way to go but I'm open to ideas for what works best.

What I want users to be able to do:

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"A clean, filterable, easy-to-update system..." – that's the dream, isn't it? I totally get it. I once spent a week building a similar system for a filmmaker friend's sound library, only to realize the UI was a usability nightmare. Lesson learned!

For your music database, here's what I'm thinking: 1) we brainstorm the *best* way to integrate with ThriveCart Learn, considering how your users will actually *use* it. 2) We'll create a simple but effective filter/search function based on the mood and other categories you need. 3) Then, I'll build you a super-easy back-end process for updating the playlist database to save you time, and making it easy for you to make changes yourself.

If this sounds good, I'm happy to jump on a quick call to chat more about your specific needs. No pressure either way.</div>
