        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We’re building a React-based web app that allows users to search for medical products (by active ingredient, DIN, etc.) .

We need a skilled frontend developer who can own the UI work and collaborate closely with our backend structure (Node.js + MongoDB).

You’ll be responsible for building:
	•	A login page using React (JWT auth handling)
	•	A search page with filters and result suggestions
	•	Clean, modern UI using TailwindCSS (or similar)
	•	Integration with backend APIs (Node.js/Express)
	•  ...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" - I hear you. I was just helping a client optimize their inventory management, and the sheer amount of manual data entry was mind-boggling. We moved them to an automated sync, and the relief was palpable!

Regarding your product search app, I envision starting with the API integration – ensuring we're getting the right data flowing into the React components. Then, focus on building out that intuitive search page with Tailwind – I’ve found starting with the user journey really helps solidify the UI. Finally, securing that login with JWT is crucial, and I'm comfortable setting that up.

Would love to chat about your MongoDB structure and how we can best integrate the frontend. Are you free for a quick call sometime this week?</div>
