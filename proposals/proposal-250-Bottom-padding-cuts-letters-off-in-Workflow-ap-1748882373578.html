        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Bottom padding cuts letters off..." â€“ that's never fun, especially when you're aiming for a unified front-end experience. I remember wrestling with similar layout issues when I was automating invoice processing for a small accounting firm. Turns out, a seemingly minor CSS tweak had cascading effects!

For this Expensify issue, I'd start by inspecting the React Native component in the approver area to pinpoint the exact padding/font rendering behavior. Then, I'd experiment with different styling approaches (flexbox, padding adjustments, maybe even a custom text component) to ensure consistent letter display. Finally, rigorous cross-platform testing (iOS/Android) to guarantee a fix that *stays* fixed.

If you're free for a quick chat sometime this week, I'd be happy to brainstorm some more specific solutions.</div>
