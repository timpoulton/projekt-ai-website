        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I read you're looking to streamline your job search for SDR and Inside Sales roles in SaaS, and that really resonates with me. I remember when I was building a similar scraper for a recruiting firm a while back, the biggest hurdle was consistently identifying true SaaS companies â€“ keywords alone weren't cutting it.

To tackle this for you, I'd initially focus on refining the APIFY scraper to be laser-focused on job titles and company descriptions, then implement a "SaaS filter" leveraging common tech stacks and business models mentioned in the listings. Finally, I'd set up the scraper to continuously monitor and alert you to new matches.

Would love to chat more about the specific SaaS companies you're targeting and brainstorm the best approach. Let me know if you're free for a quick call.</div>
