        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Integration challenges" - I hear you loud and clear! I've tackled similar Calendly/Webflow setups where getting the data flow right after form submissions can be a bit tricky. Once I spent an entire day troubleshooting why Hubspot wasn't triggering Calendly routing, turns out it was a single misconfigured field mapping. Super frustrating!

For your project, I'd start by carefully reviewing your Hubspot form and how it's connected to Calendly routing. Then, I'd set up a test environment in Webflow to mirror your live site and ensure the integration works perfectly. Finally, we'll deploy it to your live site, testing everything thoroughly.

Would love to chat for 15 minutes and see if my experience aligns well with your specific needs.</div>
