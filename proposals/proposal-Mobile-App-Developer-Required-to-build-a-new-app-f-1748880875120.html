        <p>Hi,

I need a mobile app developer to build a mobile app from scratch. It will require flutter or react frontend, and a db and APIs. I am open to suggestions and tech stack. No work has been done so far, but it needs to be cross platform and work on iOS and Playstore both. Deployment will be done by you as well, however I will pay for the store fees to store directly.

Thanks</p>

        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Reading your project, especially "No work has been done so far, but it needs to be cross platform," immediately made me think of a project I did a few years back. A local bakery needed a simple ordering app, and they were in a similar boat â€“ completely starting from scratch. We initially debated native apps, but the budget quickly dictated Flutter. It was surprisingly smooth, and the clients were happy.

For your app, I'd suggest first figuring out the absolute core functionality needed for a 'minimum viable product' (MVP) and then nail down a simple design wireframe to ensure we're on the same page visually. Once those foundations are in place, we can then develop and deploy for both iOS and Android.

I'm curious to learn more about the specifics you have in mind. Would you be available for a quick chat sometime this week?</div>
