        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw your project description mentioning the need to automate processes with Make.com â€“ especially the part about creating content, uploading, and then manually wrangling that info into Google Sheets. I totally get it. I was helping a photographer friend streamline his workflow the other day, and just the Google Drive upload step was eating up half his afternoon!

For your setup, I'd initially focus on connecting TG messenger to Make.com to trigger the image creation in Midjourney. Then, feed that image to your LLM for feedback, and finally automatically upload everything to Drive and update the Google Sheet. We can tackle this in stages to make sure everything's smooth.

I'm available for a quick chat to see how this all comes together. Let me know if you're free sometime this week.</div>
