        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Hoping I can use Instagram accounts from prior auto DM service to add to my ManyChat funnel" - I saw that, and that's exactly the kind of thing I love figuring out. I remember a client a while back who had a similar situation after migrating from a different platform; we had to get creative with custom fields and tags to segment everything properly, and it actually ended up improving their overall data hygiene in the long run.

For you, I'd suggest first mapping out your ideal customer journey *within* ManyChat, then building the chat flows with clear conversion points for email capture. After that, we could explore how to ethically integrate those existing Instagram accounts, focusing on compliance and avoiding any spam flags.

Let's chat and see if my experience aligns with your specific needs? Happy to hop on a quick call.</div>
