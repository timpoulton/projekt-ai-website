        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>I’m looking to hire someone who can help me get my finances organized, specifically for tax prep. Your main job will be to go through all my 2024 bank statements, categorize every transaction, and build a clear, clean transaction summary I can send to my CPA.

You’ll also help me set up a system that keeps me better prepared moving forward—ideally making next year’s tax season way easier.

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Getting my finances organized, specifically for tax prep..." I hear you loud and clear! I've been there myself, even with my automation background. A few years back, I spent a whole weekend wrestling with uncategorized PayPal transactions – never again!

For this project, I'd start by reviewing your 2024 bank statements, carefully categorizing each transaction into a spreadsheet that's easy for your CPA to understand. Then, we'll build a simple system – maybe using a free tool you're already familiar with – to make categorization a breeze going forward. The goal is to take a bit of the burden off your shoulders.

If you're open to it, I'd love to chat for a few minutes about your specific needs and how my approach could make your next tax season a little smoother.</div>
