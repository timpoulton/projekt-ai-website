        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're focusing on "manual processes" and the challenges with offshore outsourcing. Been there! Early in my automation career, I worked with a team drowning in spreadsheets trying to track project progress across three time zones. It was a mess.

I think we could tackle that head-on by first focusing on documenting your current workflow, then identifying those specific bottlenecks. Finally, based on that, suggesting some automation tweaks to streamline communication and reporting.

Would be happy to chat more about the nuances of your current setup and how we can get things flowing more smoothly. Let me know if you're free for a quick call!</div>
