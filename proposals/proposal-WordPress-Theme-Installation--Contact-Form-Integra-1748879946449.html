        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for someone to install a theme and get that contact form working smoothly. "Integration challenges" definitely ring a bell! I remember wrestling with a quirky theme a few months back – turns out the form plugin was conflicting with a Javascript library. Drove me nuts for a few hours!

Here’s how I'd tackle this for you: First, I'd get the theme installed and looking sharp. Then, I'd integrate the contact form plugin and test it thoroughly, paying close attention to those design guidelines you mentioned. Finally, I’d double-check everything to make sure it's all playing nicely together.

Let me know if you'd like to chat about your specific theme and design. I'm happy to jump on a quick call to see if I'm a good fit for this.</div>
