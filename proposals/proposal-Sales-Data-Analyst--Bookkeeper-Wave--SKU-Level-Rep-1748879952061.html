        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Manual processes" – I hear you loud and clear. I've seen that exact pain point cripple growth before. A few years back, I helped a small e-commerce store drowning in spreadsheets. What started as a simple SKU-level reporting solution morphed into a complete inventory overhaul because they finally *saw* the real data.

For you, I’d suggest starting with Wave setup – ensuring it's properly integrated for payroll and bookkeeping. Then, tackling that SKU-level reporting. My experience suggests a good initial discussion of current sales data, building a dynamic dashboard to showcase the metrics that matter most, and finally, implementing regular updates to ensure no one is left behind.

Would love to chat for 15 minutes and see if my approach resonates with you and your client. Let me know when works!</div>
