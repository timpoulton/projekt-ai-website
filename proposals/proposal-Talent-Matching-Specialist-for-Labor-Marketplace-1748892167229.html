        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to refine your talent matching, and the words "identifying and matching qualified candidates" jumped out. I've spent years automating candidate workflows, and I remember one startup struggling with just that. They had great candidates, but the manual matching was killing their onboarding speed.

For your marketplace, I'd focus on first, understanding your current matching logic and pinpointing bottlenecks. Then, I'd explore automating parts of the candidate profiling and initial job matching. Finally, we'd integrate it all so you could measure improvements.

If this sounds useful, I'd be happy to chat more about your current setup and what automation could do for you.</div>
