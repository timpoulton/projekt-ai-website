        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

"I don’t really know the difference," you said about blog posts and newsletters – totally understandable! I actually had a client last year in a similar spot. They thought they needed a full-blown blog, but after chatting, a well-designed newsletter with snippets of blog content worked better for their audience.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with:
1. Crafting that template for either a blog post or newsletter, focusing on a clean design that integrates seamlessly with HubSpot or MailerLite (whichever you prefer).
2. Embedding that call-to-action button to collect those new subscribers.
3. Designing a simple, automated follow-up sequence within your chosen CRM to nurture those leads.

Happy to have a quick chat about your specific content and goals to figure out the best approach. Let me know if you're free sometime next week.</div>
