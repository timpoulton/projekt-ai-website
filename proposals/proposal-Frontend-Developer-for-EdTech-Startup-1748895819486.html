        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Key Pain Points Detected: manual processes" – that really jumped out at me. I spent a year untangling a similar situation for a small healthcare provider. Their patient onboarding was entirely manual, and the bottleneck was brutal.

For FireCert, focusing on automating those key manual processes seems like a great first step. I'd suggest a quick discovery call to really pinpoint the biggest time sinks, then map out a streamlined workflow to automate those tasks. Finally, a phased automation implementation to ensure your team adapts smoothly.

Interested in chatting more about your specific challenges? I'm happy to jump on a call and explore some ideas.

Cheers,

Timothy</div>
