        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there! I saw you're looking to build a Wix site for your 3D printing business and need to make it visually appealing with e-commerce. I get it â€“ managing that stuff manually can eat up a ton of time you could be spending actually *printing*.

I remember helping a local artist a while back who was selling their sculptures online. They were drowning in spreadsheets! For you, a good first step might be setting up Wix Stores with clean product photos. Then, we can tackle SEO basics so your site actually gets found. Finally, think about embedding some interactive 3D models right into the product pages for an engaging experience.

If you'd like to chat about how that might work for you, I'm happy to jump on a quick call. Let me know!</div>
