        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Sounds like you're looking to tame some of the chaos around product ops by "connecting tools like Zapier, Linear, Jira, and AI agents." I totally get that – the more tools you have, the harder it can be to actually *use* them effectively!

Reminds me of a situation last year where a client was drowning in Trello cards, Slack channels, and Google Docs. The information was *there*, just completely inaccessible.

For your project, I'd start by mapping out the entire product development lifecycle visually, pinpointing those specific pain points. Then, we'd build out targeted workflows to automatically move information between your key tools. Finally, we'd integrate AI agents to help the system learn as you work.

If you’re curious to chat about how this might look in practice for your specific setup, let me know. No pressure at all!</div>
