        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi there,

Saw you're looking for someone to build GoHighLevel funnels and really want to drive conversions and customer engagement. Manual processes are the killer, I get it. I was helping a photographer friend move from spreadsheets to a proper booking funnel in GoHighLevel last year. He was drowning in emails, completely missing leads. It was amazing to see how quickly a well-designed funnel freed him up to focus on, well, photography!

For your project, I'd start by digging into your existing customer journey and understanding those pain points in detail, then map out a funnel strategy in GoHighLevel that eliminates the manual steps, and finally, implement and test everything thoroughly to make sure it's delivering the results you're looking for.

Happy to chat more about how I can help. Let me know when's good for you.</div>
