        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>Description:
We are looking for a responsible and detail-oriented freelancer to help rewrite and reupload 1,000 articles originally published in non-English Wikipedias. Your job will be to find relevant articles, translate them into English using Google Gemini, and then upload them to our content management system (CMS).

You will receive a clear step-by-step instruction file explaining the workflow. The process is simple, repetitive, and does not require technical skills beyond basic web publis...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Okay, I understand the repetitive nature of this â€“ "simple, repetitive" work, you said. Been there! I actually automated data entry for a small library once, and after a week of building the script, I realized I *missed* the mindless work! It's a weird feeling.

For your project, I'd start by running a few test articles through Gemini and your CMS to get a feel for the flow and potential formatting quirks. Then, create a checklist based on your instructions to ensure consistency across all articles. Finally, after uploading in batches of 100, I'd send you a quick progress report.

If this sounds like a solid approach, I'm happy to chat more about the specifics and how I can best support your project.</div>
