        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>We are looking for an experienced full-stack development team (or lead developer with a designer) to build a complete AI-powered legal SaaS platform from scratch. The platform, called Torat.AI, will allow users to generate legal documents using GPTâ€‘4, manage clause libraries, scan for risks, use e-signatures, and subscribe to paid plans via Stripe.


Key Requirements:

Design all UI/UX screens (landing, login, dashboard, generator wizard, subscription page, etc.)

Hey there,

Saw you're building Torat.AI and flagged integration challenges specifically. Been there! I once spent a week wrestling with a finicky payment gateway for a similar subscription model; turned out the API documentation was outdated. Frustrating, but a good reminder to test early and often.

For your project, I'd suggest starting with a focused UI/UX design sprint to nail down the user flows and ensure everything feels intuitive. Then, we can build the core GPT-4 document generation engine with modular architecture to make future integrations (like e-signatures and Stripe) much smoother. Finally, rigorous testing is crucial before launch.

I'm a solo freelancer with 20 years in automation, though I partner with designers for the UI/UX elements when needed. If you're open to chatting more about your vision for Torat.AI, I'd be happy to brainstorm.</div>
