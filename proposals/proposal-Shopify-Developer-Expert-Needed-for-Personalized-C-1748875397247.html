        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>**Project Overview:**
I'm launching a Shopify store to sell personalized, diabetes-themed children’s books. I need help setting up the product variants, personalization, and print-on-demand (POD) integration—along with potential ongoing CRO and SEO support.

Each book is pre-made based on variant combinations (13 boy and 26 girl versions by skin tone and hairstyle). Customers will choose a variant and add their child's name to the front cover, which should trigger the correct book file to be pri...</p>

        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"Setting up the product variants, personalization, and POD integration" – I get it. That combination can be tricky to wrangle in Shopify! I remember helping a toy store a few years back with a similar customization flow, and the initial setup felt like untangling Christmas lights.

To get your book store running smoothly, I'd suggest first focusing on nailing the variant logic and naming conventions to keep everything organized. Then, tackling the personalization aspect with an app that plays nicely with your POD service. Finally, we'd optimise your SEO so parents find your awesome books.

Would love to chat for a few minutes to understand the specifics of your POD integration and explore some app options? No pressure either way, just happy to share what I've learned.</div>
