        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

Saw you're looking for a Director of Marketing, and the "integration challenges" you mentioned immediately resonated. I've spent the last 20 years connecting all sorts of systems for businesses, and marketing stacks are often the trickiest!

Early on, I automated a CRM for a small retailer that completely disconnected their email marketing. A nightmare! Learned a valuable lesson about phased rollouts and testing.

My approach here would be to first map your current tech landscape, identify integration bottlenecks, and then build a streamlined automation roadmap to improve efficiency.

If you're curious about how I might approach your situation, I'd be happy to chat for a few minutes and share some initial thoughts. No pressure either way.</div>
