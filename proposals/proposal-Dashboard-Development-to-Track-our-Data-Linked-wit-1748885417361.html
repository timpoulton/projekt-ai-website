        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

"The job is from scratch, we don't have a set design yet - we want someone smart and quick" - I get that completely. I remember when I first started automating data for a cleaning company; they had *mountains* of Service Monster data, but no real way to see what was happening. It was like trying to drive with the windshield covered!

Based on your needs, here's how I'd tackle it: 1) dive deep into the SM API with you to figure out the *most* impactful data to track, 2) sketch out some dashboard design options based on that, and then 3) build a dashboard that is both insightful and user-friendly.

Would love to chat more about your SM setup and what you're hoping to achieve. Maybe a quick call to brainstorm?</div>
