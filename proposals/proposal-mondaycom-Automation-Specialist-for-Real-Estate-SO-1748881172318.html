        <h2>Your Proposal</h2>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey there,

I saw you're looking to tackle those manual processes clogging up your real estate SOPs in monday.com. I totally get that. I once helped a small brokerage streamline their listing process, and the agent went from feeling buried in paperwork to actually having time for client calls – it was a game changer for her.

For you, I'd suggest first mapping out your current SOPs in detail, then designing custom automations within monday.com to handle repetitive tasks, and finally implementing triggers and notifications to keep everyone on the same page.

Does this approach resonate with your vision? If so, I'm happy to schedule a quick chat to dive deeper into your workflow.</div>
